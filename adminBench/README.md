# adminBench - Administrative Workbenches

This folder contains individual administrative workbenches for different infrastructure and database management systems.

## Structure

Each subfolder is a separate git repository containing administrative tools and utilities:

- **`cloudAdmin/`** - Cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes administration
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) management
  - Kubernetes cluster configuration and tools
  - Database administration tools (SQL Server, PostgreSQL)

## Usage

### Using WorkBenches (Recommended)
```bash
# From workBenches root directory
./new-project.sh
```

### Direct Access
```bash
# Navigate to specific admin bench
cd adminBench/cloudAdmin
# Use administrative tools and configurations
```

This can create additional administrative benches such as:
- Network administration tools
- Security management utilities  
- Monitoring and logging systems
- CI/CD pipeline management
