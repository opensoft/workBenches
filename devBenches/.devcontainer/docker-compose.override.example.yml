# Docker Compose Override File Example
# ===========================================
# Full host home directory is mounted in docker-compose.yml, so all
# personal configs (AI creds, git, SSH, shell) are available automatically.
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to: docker-compose.override.yml
#    cp docker-compose.override.example.yml docker-compose.override.yml
#
# 2. The docker-compose.override.yml file is gitignored and will not be committed
#
# 3. Use this file only for additional non-home volume overrides
