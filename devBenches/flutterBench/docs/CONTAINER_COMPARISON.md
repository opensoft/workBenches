# Container Comparison: FlutterBench vs Project Containers

## Overview

We use two different container approaches for Flutter development:

1. **FlutterBench** - Heavy development workbench
2. **Project Containers** - Lightweight debugging/running environment

## üìä Size & Performance Comparison

| Aspect | FlutterBench Monster | Project Container |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Dockerfile Lines** | 729 lines | 125 lines (-83%) |
| **Build Time** | 10-15 minutes | 2-3 minutes (-80%) |
| **Image Size** | ~2GB+ | ~500MB (-75%) |
| **Container Startup** | 30-60 seconds | 5-10 seconds (-80%) |
| **Use Case** | Heavy development | Debug & light work |

## üîß Tool Comparison

### FlutterBench (THE MONSTER) Includes:
- **Languages & Runtimes**: .NET SDK, Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, Java, Bun, Deno
- **Cloud Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Azure CLI, Terraform, Pulumi
- **Development Tools**: Full Android SDK with emulators, NDK, multiple build tools
- **Database Clients**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Redis
- **Text Editors**: Vim, Neovim, Emacs, Nano
- **Modern CLI Tools**: Starship, Zoxide, btop, exa, ripgrep, fd-find, fzf, bat
- **Network Tools**: nmap, netcat, httpie, tcpdump, wireshark
- **Version Control**: Git, SVN, Mercurial, Git LFS
- **DevOps**: GitHub CLI, Firebase CLI, Fastlane, Sentry CLI, k6
- **Media Tools**: ImageMagick, FFmpeg
- **Documentation**: Pandoc, LaTeX
- **Flutter Tools**: 20+ global Dart packages and CLI tools
- **Mobile Development**: CocoaPods, Figma tools, Shorebird

### Project Container (LIGHTWEIGHT) Includes:
- **Core Utilities**: curl, wget, git, unzip, xz-utils, ca-certificates
- **Flutter Essentials**: Flutter SDK 3.24.0 (stable only)
- **Android Basics**: ADB, fastboot, minimal platform-tools
- **Java Runtime**: OpenJDK 17 (for Android builds)
- **Shell**: zsh, bash, Oh My Zsh (for better UX)
- **Basic Tools**: nano, tree, jq, less (for debugging/inspection)
- **ADB Configuration**: Pre-configured for shared ADB server

## üéØ Usage Philosophy

### When to Use FlutterBench:
- **Heavy Development Work**: Code generation, complex builds, polyglot projects
- **Tool-Heavy Tasks**: Database work, cloud deployments, infrastructure
- **Learning/Exploration**: Trying new tools, experimenting with different stacks
- **Complex Flutter Projects**: Using advanced tooling, custom build processes
- **Multi-language Projects**: Working with .NET backend + Flutter frontend

### When to Use Project Containers:
- **Debugging & Testing**: Running your app, debugging issues, testing features
- **Light Development**: Small edits, quick fixes, code reviews
- **CI/CD**: Automated builds where you want fast, minimal containers
- **Demo/Presentation**: Quick project startup for demos
- **Resource-Constrained**: Limited RAM/CPU environments

## üöÄ Performance Impact

### FlutterBench Monster:
```bash
# First time build
docker build . # ~10-15 minutes, downloads GBs of tools

# Container startup
docker run ... # ~30-60 seconds to become responsive

# Memory usage
# ~500MB-1GB+ RAM usage at idle
```

### Project Container:
```bash
# First time build
docker build . # ~2-3 minutes, minimal downloads

# Container startup  
docker run ... # ~5-10 seconds to become responsive

# Memory usage
# ~100-200MB RAM usage at idle
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Recommended Workflow:
1. **Start with FlutterBench** for initial project setup, code generation, dependency management
2. **Switch to Project Container** for debugging, testing, and running the app
3. **Return to FlutterBench** when you need complex tooling or polyglot work

### Example Day:
```bash
# Morning: Heavy development in FlutterBench
cd FlutterBench
code .  # Opens with full toolchain

# Afternoon: Debug specific app issue in project container  
cd Dartwingers/myapp
code .  # Opens lightweight container, quick startup

# Evening: Deploy and infrastructure work in FlutterBench
cd FlutterBench  # Back to the monster for deployment tasks
```

## üìè Resource Requirements

### FlutterBench System Requirements:
- **RAM**: 8GB+ recommended (4GB minimum)
- **CPU**: 4+ cores recommended
- **Disk**: 5GB+ free space
- **Network**: Good bandwidth for initial setup

### Project Container System Requirements:
- **RAM**: 4GB+ recommended (2GB minimum)  
- **CPU**: 2+ cores sufficient
- **Disk**: 1GB+ free space
- **Network**: Minimal after first build

## üéØ Summary

**FlutterBench** = Swiss Army Knife (heavy but has everything)  
**Project Container** = Precision Screwdriver (light but focused)

Both containers connect to the **same shared ADB infrastructure**, so you get consistent device connectivity regardless of which container you're using.

This dual-container approach optimizes for both **developer productivity** (FlutterBench) and **resource efficiency** (Project containers).
