# Skill: Document Co-Authoring

## Triggers
- User wants to write documentation
- Creating proposals, technical specs, decision docs
- Drafting structured content
- Mentions "writing docs", "creating proposals", "drafting specs"

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering
1. Ask user for the document's purpose and audience
2. Identify key points to cover
3. Gather any existing materials or references

### Phase 2: Structure
1. Propose an outline based on document type
2. Get user approval on structure
3. Identify sections that need user input vs. agent drafting

### Phase 3: Iterative Drafting
1. Draft one section at a time
2. Present for user review
3. Refine based on feedback
4. Repeat until complete

### Phase 4: Verification
1. Read through complete document
2. Verify it works for intended audience
3. Check for consistency and completeness
4. Final polish and formatting

## Document Types

- **Technical Specs**: Focus on precision, include diagrams
