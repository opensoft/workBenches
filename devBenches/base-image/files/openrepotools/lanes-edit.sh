#
# Protocol: ~/.agents/protocols/lane-collision-protocol.md, Rule 9 (registry in
# git) and Rule 10 (workstation designation), Amendment 3, 2026-09-09 — moved
# to the person's workspace repository by Amendment 5, 2026-09-10.
#
# WHERE THE REGISTER LIVES (Amendment 5, 2026-09-10; Amendment 9(a), 2026-09-13)
#   `lanes/LANES.md` on `main` of THE PERSON'S OWN workspace repository — the
#   `<org>/<login>-wip` that `$AGENT_PROTOCOL_ROOT/workspace.yaml` names, which
#   is `opensoft/brett-wip` for the person this file was written for and
#   `opensoft/scott-wip` for the next one. This file names no repository of its
#   own: Amendment 5's second-person clause put a second person's register in a
#   second repository, and Amendment 9 is what made that reachable. Direct commits to
#   `main` are the norm THERE by design: the repository is excluded from the
#   organisation's PR-only ruleset precisely so that a per-edit registry
#   commit can land, which is what Rule 9 requires and what the orphan
#   `lanes` branch of `opensoft/xFactory` used to be for. That branch is
#   RETIRED, and its history came across whole with this file.
#
#   Every path a lane already uses keeps resolving:
#   `~/projects/xFactory/LANES.md` and `~/projects/xFactory/lanes-edit.sh`
#   are symlinks into the checkout, placed by `link-estates`.
#   This script never spells the checkout's own path, and since Amendment 9(a)
#   it no longer derives it from its own location either: it reads
#   `repository:` and `path:` from `$AGENT_PROTOCOL_ROOT/workspace.yaml`, the
#   same pointer file `resume` and `status` already read. This file is an
#   installed command in `~/.local/bin` with no register anywhere near it, so
#   its own directory is evidence about the command and not about a person's
#   data. Failing to find the workspace is a refusal naming
#   `openRepoTools wip init`, never a guess.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   LANES.md is edited by many concurrent lanes on more than one workstation.
#   On 2026-09-08T23:46Z a whole-file write from one session dropped two other
#   lanes' rows and a day of Rule 6 LANDED lines, and there was no history to
#   recover from. Every write now goes through this script (or an equivalent
#   single-line in-place edit followed by commit + pull --rebase + push), so the
#   registry has a history and a lost row is one `git show` away.
#
# HAZARD — `sed -i` REPLACES A SYMLINK WITH A REGULAR FILE.
#   ~/projects/xFactory/LANES.md is a SYMLINK into this worktree. Plain
#   `sed -i` unlinks it and writes a new regular file, silently detaching the
#   registry from git. Use this helper, or `sed -i --follow-symlinks`, or
#   `cat tmp > LANES.md` (a redirect follows the symlink). `>>` appends,
#   `cat`, `cut`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `python open(...,'a')` are all safe.

# AMENDMENT 7 — the per-lane object log (`lanes/log/<lane>.md`)
#   lanes-edit.sh log     <VERB> <object> [→|← <payload>] ["<text>"] [--text "<t>"]
#   lanes-edit.sh claim   <object> [--force] [--no-github] [--home owner/repo]
#   lanes-edit.sh release <object> ["<why>"] [--no-github] [--home owner/repo]
#   lanes-edit.sh who     <object> | --lane <lane> | --landing owner/repo
#
# AMENDMENT 8 — swap and restart, the READ side (both read-only, never write)
#   lanes-edit.sh swapped       [<workstation>]
#   lanes-edit.sh session-start                  # the SessionStart hook; JSON on stdin
#
#   A SWAP is a planned stop — a usage reset, a profile switch — and a RESTART
#   is the launch that follows it. The RECORD a swap leaves is not a new file:
#   it is the lane's own `PAUSED` line, payload
#   `swap; window <tmux session>:<index>; workstation <ws>`. A lane is SWAPPED
#   on a workstation when that PAUSED is its LAST lane-kind line — no later
#   RESUMED, STARTED, ENDED or RETIRED — and `swapped` lists those lanes, which
#   is how a restart finds its lane once the new tmux session has lost the
#   window name. `session-start` is the whole output of the SessionStart hook:
#   it resolves the lane from the tmux window name, else from the session id in
#   the hook's JSON, prints ONE block, and ALWAYS exits 0 — a hook that fails
#   is a hook that breaks the session it was meant to orient.
#
#   `--home owner/repo` is an option of all FIVE of `claim`, `release`, `who`,
#   `log` and `lane-end`, for a lane whose log has no STARTED line. All five
#   resolve it AFTER the fetch (R30), because the STARTED line that refuses it
#   may be a peer's and live only on `origin/<branch>`.
#
#   An object is `owner/repo#<n>`, `owner/repo:openspec/changes/<name>`, `#<n>`
#   for the lane's OWN home repo, or `lane:<name>` for the lane-kind lines.
#   `lanes/repos.tsv` (`alias<TAB>owner/repo`) resolves an omitted owner and
#   the register's legacy spellings; an unknown alias is refused, never guessed.
#   A LANE'S HOME GOES THROUGH THE SAME TABLE (R20, Addendum 5) — `lane-start`
#   resolves it before writing STARTED, and every comparison of an object's
#   repository against a home resolves BOTH sides. A home is inherited by every
#   `#<n>` that lane writes, so a legacy org spelling there gave one GitHub
#   issue two object keys and two lanes held it with no collision detected.
#
#   STATE IS PER LANE: a lane's state on an object is its own LAST line naming
#   it, and it HOLDS the object while that verb is open. Open is
#   {CLAIMED, TAKEOVER, OPENED, LANDING, WITHDRAWN}; closed — and it closes
#   only the writing lane's hold — is {RELEASED, CLAIM-LOST, CLOSED, LANDED}.
#
#   THAT APPLIES TO A TAKEOVER TOO (R18, Addendum 5): lane B's TAKEOVER on an
#   object supersedes lane A's CLAIMED only while the TAKEOVER is B's OWN LAST
#   LINE on it. Once B writes RELEASED, CLOSED or LANDED there, A's later
#   CLAIMED holds normally. A TAKEOVER is never removed from an append-only
#   log, so treating one as superseding for ever made a legitimate re-claim
#   invisible: `who` called a held object FREE and `claim` did not refuse the
#   next lane. Known and deliberate: two lanes each ending on a TAKEOVER of one
#   object are BOTH reported as holders — a visible conflict, and not reachable
#   through the helpers, since `claim --force` takes over a stale CLAIMED only.
#
#   AND "LAST" IS THE LAST LINE IN THE FILE (R14, Addendum 4). A lane's log is
#   append-only and single-writer, so the ORDER OF ITS LINES is the order of
#   that lane's writes. No state read here — `lane_objects`, `superseded_by`,
#   PER_LANE_AWK, `who` in any mode, `lane-end`'s refusal, `claim`'s pre-check
#   and its rescan — selects or orders lines by their UTC field. The UTC stays
#   on every line as INFORMATION, and is compared only where a DURATION is the
#   rule: Rule 1's four-hour staleness and Rule 6's thirty minutes, where a few
#   seconds are immaterial. On 2026-09-11 this workstation's realtime clock was
#   observed jumping ±25s in bursts and a log commit landed whose content
#   carried a UTC 26s after its own committer date; a max-UTC read made that
#   lane's newest line invisible. Two workstations never share a clock either.
#
#   `claim` is Rule 1 as one act, and THE RACE IS DECIDED BY WHICH CLAIMED
#   LANDS ON `main` FIRST, never by comparing timestamps: fetch, pre-check
#   against `origin/main`, append, commit, push; on a rebase, rescan, and if
#   another lane's claim is already there, write `CLAIM-LOST` and stop. Git's
#   push serialization is the arbiter between workstations; the `mkdir` mutex
#   below only serializes this one.
#
#   EVERY STATE READ IS OF `origin/<branch>`, AFTER A FETCH — never of the
#   working tree. What has LANDED is what other lanes can see; a working tree
#   can be behind by a peer's whole day. `who`, the pre-check, staleness, the
#   superseded filter, the crossing warning, `lane-end`'s refusal and
#   `lane-start`'s home lookup all read the same source, so they cannot
#   disagree with each other either.
#
#   THE REGISTER'S ROWS ARE READ THE SAME WAY (R19, Addendum 5). The session
#   cell, the handoff path and the workstation column come from
#   `git show origin/<branch>:lanes/LANES.md`; nothing in `who` reads the
#   working tree. THE ONE EXCEPTION IS THE `live-holder` SUBCOMMAND, and only
#   its id SET (R25, Addendum 6): it is the published row's union this
#   checkout's, because a session stamps its uuid on the row with
#   `replace-in-row` and that write is a LOCAL COMMIT until its push lands —
#   read from `origin` alone the rename gate would not see the uuid of the very
#   session it is being asked to rename over, would answer 8, and `lane-start`
#   would take the name. That is what mints `<lane> (2)` (AGENTS.md rule 7).
#   Liveness fails closed, so an id `origin` has not seen is a reason to refuse
#   a rename, never to allow one, and nothing that PRINTS uses the union.
#
#   A LANDED CLOSES THE LANDING IT ANSWERS (R17, Addendum 5): `who --landing`
#   pairs them by (lane, PR) in FILE ORDER and keys the result on
#   (lane, repository, PR). Most of the register's LANDED lines carry no
#   `into <repo> main` clause, and keying those on the repository they name
#   reported 232 phantom merge holds where one was real.
#
# EXIT CODES — every subcommand, one table, no two meanings on one number
#   0  done
#   1  environment (no register, no writer)
#   2  refusal: bad arguments, the object is held, an unknown alias, or a
#      checkout that cannot be rebased
#   3  rebase conflict — nothing was pushed, the edit is a local commit
#   4  the mutex could not be taken within 60s
#   5  an edit moved more than one line and was refused
#   6  git add / commit / push failed
#   7  CLAIM-LOST — another lane's claim landed on main first (`claim` only)
#   8  no record — `who` found nothing; `lane-objects` has no log file for the
#      lane; `live-holder` READ this workstation's session records and none of
#      them holds it; `swapped` found no lane swapped on the workstation;
#      `window-session` found no live session in the window. A read that could
#      not be performed is never 8 (R22). `session-start` never exits 8, or
#      anything but 0: it is a hook.
#
# --no-sweep (DEFAULT, added 2026-09-09 after 0d84d34/a1f2438 swept another
#   lane's uncommitted hand edit into an unrelated commit): every mutating
#   subcommand checks, before making its own edit, whether LANES.md is
#   already dirty. If it is, that content is someone else's — never this
#   invocation's — so it is committed FIRST, on its own, as
#   `LANES(pre-existing@<workstation>): capture an uncommitted registry edit
#   (row <lane>)`, before this invocation's own edit is made and committed.
#   A WARNING (with `git diff --stat` and the first 200 chars of every
#   changed line) always prints first. This never fails the call — the
#   write still goes through. Amendment 7's `log`, `claim` and `release` take
#   the same capture for the REGISTER between the two halves of their
#   dirty-checkout guard, which is why a peer's half-written `lanes/LANES.md`
#   does not refuse them (Addendum 3, R11); any OTHER modified tracked file
#   still does, and is refused before the capture rather than after it.
# --sweep — the old behaviour: leave the pre-existing content staged so it
#   lands inside this invocation's own commit. Still warns exactly as above,
#   and appends " + sweeps uncommitted edit to row <lane>" to the commit
#   subject, so the sweep is never silent.
# `commit` has no edit of its own to separate from a pre-existing one — its
#   job IS to wrap whatever is already dirty. It instead warns and appends
#   the same " + sweeps uncommitted edit to row <lane>" note when the dirty
#   content touches a row other than the caller's own $LANES_LANE.

# --- THE WORKSPACE REPOSITORY (lane-collision-protocol Amendment 9(a)) -------
#
# The person's data — the register `lanes/LANES.md`, the object logs
# `lanes/log/`, the handoffs, the manifests `park` writes, and a
# `lanes/repos.tsv` override — is found through
# `$AGENT_PROTOCOL_ROOT/workspace.yaml`, and NEVER from this file's own
# location. `resume:466` and `status:1673` already read that same file under
# that same name, and Amendment 9(a) mints no second one: a second way to find
# it is a second answer.
#
# Deriving it from here stopped being POSSIBLE the moment this became an
# installed regular file in `~/.local/bin` with no register anywhere near it,
# and it stopped being WANTED for a subtler reason: a file's location on disk
# is evidence about the file, not about a person's data.
#
# THESE FOUR FUNCTIONS ARE A DELIBERATE COPY, byte for byte, across
# `lanes-edit.sh`, `lane-start`, `lane-end` and `link-estates` — the same trade
# openRepoTools already makes for its own fetch shim (`openRepoTools:93-100`).
# A shared `lanes-common.sh` would be a TENTH file for `--install` to place and
# a broken helper the first time somebody copied only some of them. Each of
# these is one file a person has on PATH.
#
# FAILING TO FIND IT IS A REFUSAL, NEVER A GUESS. No file, no `path:`, no
# `repository:`, or a `path:` that is not the root of a checkout of the
# `repository:` named beside it → the caller refuses, exit 1 — the code
# `lanes-edit.sh` has always used for *registry not found* — with the fix
# named: `openRepoTools wip init`. Nothing here ever creates that file, writes
# a register, or falls back to a path derived from its own location. THE
# CHECKOUT TEST IS NEW: nothing validated it before this, so a `path:` pointing
# at some other repository used to be accepted and now is not.
#
# `LANES_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is the test seam and the only override — the seam
# `lane-start` already spelled for handoff resolution, widened to the whole
# question so `test_lane_helpers.sh` can point every helper at one sandbox.
# --- BEGIN shared workspace resolver (Amendment 9(a)) ----------------------
# BYTE-IDENTICAL IN ALL FOUR LANE HELPERS, and held there by
# `tests/test_repo_hygiene.py`. The estate commands carry the same discipline
# for their own estate resolver and for the same reason its guard gives: a
# drifted copy is TWO ANSWERS to one question, and "where is this person's
# workspace" is exactly the question Amendment 9(a) exists to give one answer
# to. Edit it in one file and the test names the other three.

# THE WORKSTATION'S NAME IS READ, NEVER INVENTED — AND NEVER `hostname` INSIDE A
# CONTAINER (lane-collision-protocol Amendment 11, ratified decision 8(d), as
# corrected by A11 Addendum 3's `R-A11-14`).
#
# WHAT WENT WRONG. `opensoft/brett-wip` `origin/main` carries SIX lines in
# `lanes/log/openRepoProject-1.md` whose workstation is a container id — five
# `@0e7d1a79a07e`, one `@55cceb3e5bc9` — in an append-only file, written by every
# writer inside that container and not only by Evidence 6's fork. A row on a
# workstation that does not exist is a row no reader can match, no crossing can
# detect and no `swapped <ws>` can answer for; and the log is never rewritten, so
# each one is wrong for ever.
#
# WHO OWNS THE VALUE. `R-A11-14`: the **workBenches launcher**, which runs on the
# host and exports `LANES_WORKSTATION=<the host's own hostname -s>` into every
# session AND every container it starts, beside the `CLAUDE_PROFILE_NAME` it
# already exports. These helpers READ it. They do not write it, they do not
# derive it from a second file, and THEY NEVER SUBSTITUTE A PLACEHOLDER: an
# `@unknown-workstation` is the same defect one field along from the `unknown`
# clause (e) refuses in the session field, and the rejected alternative — a
# `workstation:` key in `workspace.yaml` — is a SECOND PLACE FOR THE TRUTH TO BE
# WRONG beside the variable the launcher already sets.
#
# THE THREE ANSWERS, as `<name><TAB><source>`:
#
#   seam              `$LANES_WORKSTATION` is set. This is the ordinary case
#                     wherever the launcher started the session.
#   hostname          no seam, and this is NOT a container: `hostname -s`, which
#                     is what the seam has defaulted to since Amendment 6 and
#                     what every row written before this rung was written by.
#   container-unset   no seam, and this IS a container. The NAME still answers,
#                     because a read in front of every launch may not refuse —
#                     it will simply match nothing, which is the honest answer —
#                     but every WRITER refuses, exit 2, naming the variable and
#                     the launcher that sets it.
#
# IT ANSWERS AS A PAIR, AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. A caller reads the name
# with `$(lanes_workstation)`, which is a COMMAND SUBSTITUTION and therefore a
# subshell: a global the function set there dies with it. The source is on the
# same line as the name, which is the only way out of a subshell there is.
#
#   $LANES_IN_CONTAINER   1 or 0, forcing the probe. THE TEST SEAM, and nothing
#                         else sets it: the suite must be able to exercise both
#                         halves of this rule on one host, and the host it runs

#
# On 2026-09-12 at about 01:44Z an ssh `git-receive-pack` hung for five minutes
# AFTER its push had already landed, and `lanes-edit.sh append-row-status` sat
# inside it holding the mutex for the whole five minutes. Every lane on Eagle
# that wanted to write a row waited behind a lock whose holder was blocked on a
# socket, and the estate only moved again when the ssh was killed by hand.
#
# So every git call that touches the NETWORK — push, pull, fetch, ls-remote —
# runs under a timeout, and a timeout is not a failure to retry: it is a
# refusal to hold the mutex any longer. The helper aborts any rebase it started,
# releases the lock, prints how to find out whether the push landed anyway, and
# exits 3 with the edit safe in a local commit.
#
# `LANES_GIT_TIMEOUT` is the budget in seconds (default 60; 0 disables the
# bound). `LANES_GIT` is the binary, so a test can hand these calls — and ONLY
# these calls — a git that hangs, without shadowing git for the rest of the

# much of the day — the register takes ~500 commits a day and a half-written
# row is what one of them looks like a second before it lands — so refusing
# every `claim`, `log` and `release` on it would push lanes to stop using the
# tool, and the pre-existing capture already exists precisely to make that
# state safe to rebase over. So: capture FIRST, exactly as every register
# write has done since --no-sweep (the warning included), and let the guard
# re-test the checkout afterwards.
#
# Only when the register is NOT one of this write's own pathspecs: a LANDING
# or a LANDED commits it itself, and the ordinary handle_preexisting call
# covers it there, --sweep included. There is nothing to sweep a register edit
# INTO when this commit does not touch the register, so this capture is always
# its own commit whatever --sweep says.
#
# It is reached only AFTER write_event's first guard, so it never commits on
# behalf of a write that is about to refuse: a checkout dirty in anything ELSE
# is refused before the lock and before this runs, and a refusal that had
# already committed a peer's register edit would be a refusal that wrote.

# ======================================================== Amendment 7 ======
#
# THE PER-LANE OBJECT LOG.
#
#   lanes/log/<lane>.md — one file per lane, append-only, line 1 a header,
#   every other line an EVENT. This helper is the only writer, for the same
#   reason it is the register's only writer. One file per lane is also what
#   makes two workstations safe: two lanes writing at once touch two files.
#
#   <VERB> — lane <lane>, session <uuid>@<ws>, <UTC>, <object>[ → <payload>][ — <free text>]
#
#   The verb is ONE token. The first four fields are separated by `, `. The
#   OBJECT token contains no space and no comma; everything after it up to
#   ` — ` is payload, whose sub-fields are separated by `; ` and whose refs
#   are space-separated.
#
#   STATE IS PER LANE. A lane's state on an object is that lane's LAST line
#   naming it — the last such line IN THE FILE, never the largest UTC (R14);
#   the lane HOLDS the object when that verb is in the OPEN set; the object is
#   HELD when any lane holds it. There is no index file: a read fetches and
#   greps, because 45 lanes' logs together are smaller than one of the
#   register's rows.
#
#   LANES.md is unchanged. Its rows stay its rows and its Rule 6 LANDING /
#   LANDED lines stay where every lane already reads them as the merge hold —
#   which is why `who --landing` reads THOSE and not the logs. A LANDING or
#   LANDED writes both files in one commit, with two pathspecs.

# ------------------------------------- AMENDMENT 8, ruling (g): WHOSE session
#
# Three facts about this estate's records, every one of them observed on
# 2026-09-12 while `lane-start` was refusing the very window that held the lane:
#
#   1. THE HARNESS EXPORTS `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` into every shell a session
#      runs — so a `lane-start` that a session runs already knows its own
#      transcript id without asking the filesystem anything. That is the
#      cheapest and the most certain test there is, and it comes first.
#   2. ONE SESSION WRITES MORE THAN ONE RECORD. Beside the interactive process
#      in the pane the harness runs a companion: `kind: bg`, no `tmux`, no
#      `nameSource`, its own pid, and THE SAME `sessionId`. Records that share a
#      `sessionId` are one session, not a queue of rival holders, and there is
#      no contest between them to win.
#   3. A RECORD MAY CARRY NO `tmux` AT ALL. The pane's interactive record
#      usually has one, the companion never does, and the harness has been seen
#      to write none for a process plainly in a window. "No target" is not "no
#      window": it is a missing observation, and the process tree holds the
#      answer the record failed to write down.
#
# What those three produced: `live_holder` returned the COMPANION — its
# `sessionId` matched the row, its pid was alive, and carrying no `nameSource`
# it survived the name test — reported its target as `none`, and `lane-start`
# read "not this window" and refused the session that was running the command:
#
#   lane openRepoProject-1 is live in session c5701b54… (tmux none);
#   take openRepoProject-2 or resume that window
#
# The orphaned idle holder from the PREVIOUS profile was a real find and was
# correctly retired under Amendment 6(d); this one was the same shape read
# wrongly. The difference between them is not recency and never was — it is
# whether the process is in THIS pane's tree.

# A `kind: bg` record is a COMPANION: never a holder, never a rival, skipped by
# every read that asks who holds a lane or what is in a window. Only
# `interactive` records hold a lane; a record from a harness too old to say
# carries no `kind` at all and is read as interactive, because that is the only
# thing those harnesses ever wrote.

# R22 — IT FAILS CLOSED AT THE SOURCE. Three answers, and they are distinct:
#   0  a live record holds the lane (the row is printed)
#   8  the records were READ, and none of them does
#   1  the records could not be read — a permissions or IO fault
#
# AND ON 0 IT SAYS WHOSE (Amendment 8, ruling (g)). The fifth field is the
# verdict — `here`, `elsewhere` or `orphan` — because the caller that has to act
# on it cannot work it out from the `tmux` column: a record with no target is
# not a record in no window, and `lane-start` refusing on that string is what
# refused this lane its own window. `here` beats `elsewhere` beats `orphan`, and
# a record with no target whose SESSION also wrote a windowed record is that
# same session seen twice, not a second holder — it is dropped, never ranked.
# `lane-start` renames a window on 8 and REFUSES on anything else, so collapsing
# a failed read into 8 is exactly how a running lane loses its address: the
# rename mints `<lane> (2)` (AGENTS.md rule 7). The first version returned 1 for
# both, which is the same fault one layer up; hardening the CALLER left this

# -------------------------------- AMENDMENT 8(f), R-A8-6: the ORPHANED HOLDERS
#
# A row's session cell is a HISTORY, and its EARLIER ids are history rather than
# alternatives — but a live process can still be holding one, which is Amendment
# 6(d)'s orphan and, on this lane, the reason the `/resume` picker offered two
# transcripts of which neither was the lane. `live_holder` answers about the
# lane's holder, one record, picked; this answers about ALL the earlier ids, and
# it answers to be READ.
#
# IT NAMES THEM AND DOES NOTHING ELSE. Retiring is `kill <pid>`, printed by the
# caller and run by a person: ending somebody's process is not a boundary
# script's act — an idle background session is exactly the shape of thing that
# turns out to be somebody's long-running job — and clause (f) rules it the
# operator's, for the same reason clause (a)'s step 3 pushes nobody's work for
# them.
#
# IDLE means a LIVE record (Amendment 6's three tests: a status that is not
# ended, a pid that is alive, a `procStart` that still matches) which is NOT a
# session in a window: a `kind: bg` companion, or a record carrying no `tmux`
# target at all. A live INTERACTIVE record with a window is not an orphan, it is
# a rival, and `live_holder` is the read that answers about those.

# ---------------------------------------------- the session in a tmux WINDOW
#
# AMENDMENT 8. `live_holder` asks "is any session this ROW names alive"; this
# asks "which live session is in THIS WINDOW", and the two answers differ in
# exactly the case Amendment 8 exists for. The harness mints a new transcript
# uuid without anybody acting — a `/clear` does it (Amendment 6, fact 4), and so
# did the 2026-09-12 usage reset that carried this lane's conversation into
# `4a91f1dc…` while its row still ended on `09dd34d1…`. That id is in no row, so
# `live_holder` cannot see it and answers 8, "this lane is parked", about the
# conversation sitting in the window it was asked about. Keyed on the WINDOW
# instead, the record is found, and `lane-start` appends its uuid to the cell
# before it stamps — which is what makes the next resume land in the right
# conversation.

# The profile a record belongs to, read off its own path — never guessed from
# the environment, because the process asking may be in another profile:
#   ~/.claude-profiles/profiles/<org>/<team>/<profile>/sessions/<pid>.json
#   ~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json                                 -> default

# window_session <tmux target> — the LIVE record whose own `tmux` field names

# `tmux display-message -p '#{session_name}:#{window_id}'` prints and what the
# record's `tmux` field carries before its `.%<pane>` suffix.
#
# NO NAME TEST. `live_holder`'s fifth test skips a record explicitly named for
# another lane, because there the question is "does this record hold that lane".
# Here the question is "what is running in this window", and a window holds one
# interactive session whatever it is called: the record's name is REPORTED, so
# the caller can put it in front of a person, and decides nothing.
#
# R22 — three answers, never two of them conflated: 0 with the record, 8 when
# the records were READ and none is in that window, 1 when they could not be
# read at all.
# WHERE SEVERAL LIVE RECORDS NAME ONE WINDOW, IDENTITY DECIDES — NOT RECENCY
# (Amendment 8, ruling (g); this replaces the first version's "the most recently
# updated one wins", which was wrong in the case it was written for).
#
#   tier 3  its `sessionId` is `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, which the harness
#           exported into this very shell — when the window asked about is this
#           one. Nothing beats a session naming itself.
#   tier 2  its pid is this pane's process or below it — again only for this
#           window. This is what lets a record with NO `tmux` be found: the
#           harness does not always write the target down, and a record without
#           one is not thereby in no window.
#   tier 1  its `tmux` field names the window. The fast path, and the only test
#           available for a window that is not this one.
#
# `updatedAt` breaks a tie WITHIN a tier and nowhere else, so the answer never
# depends on directory order. It cannot be the rule itself: it is a LIVENESS
# HEARTBEAT, and the idle companion beside a working session heartbeats later
# than the session does — in the 2026-09-12 records the companion's `updatedAt`
# was 1789235975177 against the interactive record's 1789235958137, so "the
# newest wins" picks precisely the record that is not in the window. Two records
# of ONE session are not a contest to win at all: the windowed one represents
# the session, and `record_is_session` has already dropped the companion.

# THE MERGE HOLD IS DECIDED FROM LANES.md, not from the logs. Rule 6's
# LANDING / LANDED lines are written for every lane, before this amendment and
# after it, and every lane already reads them there. The logs are secondary.
#
# Landings are counted as distinct (lane, repository, PR) TRIPLES, never as raw
# LANDING lines: a retry re-posts LANDING for the same PR, and the register has
# 571 such lines for far fewer landings.
#
# A LANDED CLOSES THE LANDING IT ANSWERS, PAIRED BY (lane, PR) IN FILE ORDER
# (R17). Most of the register’s LANDED lines carry no `into <repo> main` clause
# at all — 284 of 308 on the day this was measured — so keying a LANDED on the
# repository it names keyed 284 of them on the empty string, where they could
# never close the repository-qualified LANDING they belonged to: `who --landing`
# reported 201 phantom merge holds across five repositories, every one of them
# landed long ago, on a register whose genuinely open count was one. So the
# PAIRING is by (lane, PR) — the LANDED closes the most recent LANDING of that
# lane and PR that is still unmatched, and the pair’s repository is the
# LANDING’s — while the RESULT still keys on (lane, repository, PR), which is
# what keeps a LANDED on one repository from closing a LANDING on another.
# AND A LANDED THAT NAMES A REPOSITORY PREFERS A LANDING ON THAT REPOSITORY
# (R24, Addendum 6). Only a LANDED with NO `into <repo> main` clause takes the
# most recent unmatched LANDING regardless — it has said nothing about where it
# landed, so the LANDING is the only thing that can say. One that DOES name a
# repository takes the most recent unmatched LANDING naming the same one, and
# is reported as an `unpaired LANDED` — closing nothing — only when there is no
# such LANDING at all. Without the preference, a lane with two LANDINGs open on
# ONE PR number in two repositories that lands the EARLIER one, naming its
# repository, was unpaired and both holds stayed open until the second landed.
# The answer is identical everywhere else, including the (lane, repository, PR)
# result key: a LANDED on one repository still closes no LANDING on another.
#
# The repository is lower-cased IN THE KEY ONLY: the register spells one
# repository four ways in a week, and a LANDED spelled `OpsxFactory` must still
# close a LANDING spelled `opsXfactory`.
#
# AND BOTH SIDES GO THROUGH `lanes/repos.tsv` FIRST (R29, Addendum 7). Case is
# only half of it: the register writes `OpsxFactory` and `opensoft/OpsxFactory`
# for ONE repository — 23 Rule 6 lines against 70 at `8f9c04d` — and
# `codexFactory`, `codeXfactory/codexFactory` and `opensoft/codexFactory` for
# another. Compared literally, a LANDED spelled one way does not close the
# LANDING spelled the other: it reads as an `unpaired LANDED`, the hold stays
# open, and over-reporting a merge hold is the direction that stalls other
# lanes' merges. So every `into <repo> main` is resolved AS IT IS PARSED, which
# makes the pairing, R24's preference and the (lane, repository, PR) result key
# agree by construction — the key's repository is the canonical spelling, and
# an alias the table does not know keeps its own, case-blind like every other.
#
# WHAT THAT IS WORTH TODAY, measured read-only over `origin/main` at `6fa966b`:
# the VERDICT does not move — 1 open LANDING (lane browser-ui-repair's PR #401,
# genuinely in flight) and 0 unpaired LANDED, before this change and after it.
# No (lane, PR) pair in the register mixes its spellings YET, so this is a
# guard and not a repair, and it is worth saying so rather than claiming a hold
# it did not clear. What it does move there is the KEY: 17 result-key spellings
# collapse to the 11 repositories they name, and two LANDINGs a retry spelled
# two ways are one hold instead of two.
#
# The table is handed in as `aliases`, one `<lowercased alias>\037<owner/repo>`
# per line, because awk cannot read `repos.tsv` for itself here: this program's
# stdin is the register.
#
# BOTH LAYERS, SHIPPED FIRST (Amendment 9(b)). This is the second reader of the
# table — `alias_lookup` is the other — and it layers them the same way by
# reading the shipped file before the override, so the LAST assignment to an
# alias wins and an override row REPLACES the shipped row for that alias while
# adding rows the shipped table does not carry. One map, emitted in the order
# the aliases were first seen, so the output is stable.

#
# SWAP AND RESTART, THE READ SIDE.
#
#   A SWAP is a planned stop — a usage reset, a profile switch — and a RESTART
#   is the launch that follows it. Neither adds a file. The RECORD a swap
#   leaves is the lane's own PAUSED line, payload
#   `swap; window <tmux session>:<index>; workstation <ws>`, and a lane is
#   SWAPPED on a workstation when that PAUSED is its LAST lane-kind line.
#
#   Both reads here are READ-ONLY and neither ever writes. `swapped` is what a
#   launcher asks when the tmux window name is gone — a restart opens a NEW
#   tmux session, which is precisely why the window name cannot carry the lane
#   across one. `session-start` is the SessionStart hook's whole output.

# The register's own spelling of a lane whose name matches $1 ignoring case,
# read from `origin/<branch>` like every other state read (R19). Rule 10's wire
# form is lowercase and a tmux window may carry either, while the row's token is
# camel (`openRepoProject-1`): an exact lookup alone loses the lane.

# AMENDMENT 11 — THE RECORD'S SUB-FIELDS, AND THE READS BUILT ON THEM
# ============================================================================
#
# Amendment 11 clause (c) gives the lane's `STARTED`/`RESUMED` lines and the
# swap record two new payload sub-fields, `dir <path>` and `profile <name>`,
# beside Amendment 8(b)'s `window`, which gains a second ref. Clause (h) turns
# the reads of them into subcommands, for the reason Amendment 7(d) already
# gives `live-holder` and `lane-objects`: EACH READ EXISTS SO THAT SEVERAL
# CALLERS SHARE ONE IMPLEMENTATION. `window-lane` has three (the launcher's
# precedence 3, `/restart`'s step 2(c), the `/lane-swap` skill's step 1);
# `session-lane` has two (`/restart`'s step 2(b) and the SessionStart hook);
# `lane-dir` has four. A rule implemented once cannot be implemented three
# ways, which is exactly how the launcher, the skill and `/restart` would come
# to disagree about which lane a window is.

# ONE PARSER OF A PAYLOAD'S SUB-FIELDS, AND ONE UNQUOTER.
#
# Amendment 7(b)'s grammar: sub-fields are separated by `; `, and SEVERAL REFS
# INSIDE ONE SUB-FIELD ARE SEPARATED BY SPACES — which is what the `window`
# sub-field's `<session>:<index> <@id>` relies on. So an unquoted
# `dir $HOME/my projects/x` (unquoted) parses as two refs and hands back a truncated
# path, and clause (c)'s rule is that the WRITER QUOTES a value containing a
# space and EVERY READER takes a value opening with `"` as running to its
# closing `"`, stripping both.
#
# Two modes, because the grammar has two kinds of value:
#   (default)  ONE REF — the value up to its first space, or the whole of a
#              quoted value. `dir` and `profile` are read this way.
#   all        EVERY REF — the whole sub-field, which is what `window` is:
#              two refs that a caller splits itself.

# single-writer, so a line further down the file is a line written later
# whatever the two UTC fields say.
#
# THE LAST LINE CARRYING ONE, NOT THE LAST LINE. A lane started under Amendment
# 11 and then PAUSED for a reason that is not a swap has a last line with no

#
# TWO RUNGS, first answer wins:
#   1. the window's own NAME, where the register has a row for it. That is
#      clause (b)'s precedence 2 read through the same door, so a caller that
#      asks this read a ref gets the same answer the launcher would.
#   2. this workstation's swap records, matched on the ref.
#
# SCOPED TO THE ASKING WORKSTATION, IN THE CONTRACT AND NOT ONLY IN `Open`. A
# `<session>:<index>` is a local fact about one machine, and `claude-x:0`
# written on Raven collides with `claude-y:0` on Eagle far more easily than an
# `<@id>` will. `swapped` takes `[<ws>]` for exactly that reason and this read
# takes it for the same one: records written by another workstation are NOT
# CONSIDERED.
#
# THE AGREEMENT RULE, AND THIS READ OWNS IT. Existing-now is not enough on its
# own: a record naming `claude-y:0 @97`, met from the window that has since
# taken `claude-y:0` as `@200`, passes the existing-now test on its ref and
# would bind the lane to a stranger's pane with no question — which is the
# failure the liveness fence exists to stop, arriving through the LIVE ref
# instead of the dead one. So:
#
#   a record that carries an `<@id>` is matched on its `<session>:<index>` ONLY
#   WHERE THE WINDOW NOW HOLDING THAT REF REPORTS THAT SAME ID; a record with
#   no id is matched on the ref alone.

# FORK of its transcript — `--fork-session`, a NEW session id, `kind: bg`, no
# tmux, a cwd of `/workspace` — which went on orchestrating the same plan,
# relaunched writers on the same three branches, wrote `RESUMED` and `PAUSED`
# lines into the lane's log, and messaged the interactive session claiming to
# be the holder while citing a dead pid.
#
# Amendment 8 ruling (g) already skips a `kind: bg` companion, and that is not
# enough: a fork is a SESSION OF ITS OWN with an id no row carries, so the
# thing that makes it recognisable is neither its kind nor its id but ITS
# TRANSCRIPT'S TITLE. A `--fork-session` copies the parent's `custom-title`
# record, so the fork's transcript says `openRepoProject-1` while its id says
# something the lane's row has never heard of. That pair — THE LANE'S TITLE
# UNDER AN ID THE LANE DOES NOT RECORD — is the defect, and it is what this
# read finds.
#
# IT NAMES THEM AND DOES NOTHING ELSE, exactly as `idle_holders` does and for
# the same reason clause (f) of Amendment 8 gives: retiring is `kill <pid>`,
# printed by the caller and typed by a person.
#
# One line per fork, `<session id><TAB><pid><TAB><kind><TAB><cwd>`.
# 0 with rows, 8 with none, 1 where the records could not be read.

# ------------------------------- decisions 6 and 7: THE LANE LISTING READ
#
# ONE READ, TWO LISTINGS. Decision 6 ratified the estate-wide `lanes`; decision
# 7 ratified `restart`'s per-repo listing and `/restart`'s. All three are the
# same rows with a different filter, so the filter is an argument here rather
# than three implementations in three commands — the rule clause (h) already
# gives `window-lane` and `session-lane`.
#
# READ-ONLY, out of `origin/<branch>` like every Amendment 7 read, and
# `LANES_NO_FETCH=1` is honoured by the one `log_sync` its caller makes. It
# never writes and never launches anything.
#
#   lanes_rows [--repo <owner/repo>] [--dir <path>] [--ws <ws>] [--all]
#
# `--repo` and `--dir` are decision 7's per-repo scope and they are an OR, not
# an AND: "rows whose register `home` is this checkout's `origin`, OR whose
# recorded `dir` is this checkout". That second half is a second use for clause
# (c)'s `dir` and an argument for recording it, because a lane's home
# repository and the checkout it sits in are not the same fact.
#
# Tab-separated, one line per lane, and the COLUMNS ARE THE DATA rather than a
# rendering: `restart` and `lanes` lay them out, and a third caller that wants
# a different shape does not need a fourth read.
#
#   <lane> <state> <workstation> <profile> <window> <last uuid> <dir>
#   <objects> <age> <home> <forks>

# a clock and it decides nothing but the ORDER OF A LISTING, which is the one

# swapped_lanes [<workstation>] — one row per swapped lane, tab-separated:
#   <lane>	<UTC>	<window>
#
# WHICH LINE IS A LANE'S "LAST" IS FILE ORDER (R14), like every other state read
# here: a lane's log is append-only and single-writer, so a line further down
# the file is a line written later whatever the two UTC fields say — and this is
# the read a restart resolves its lane from, so letting a clock decide it would
# be the same fault Amendment 7 removed everywhere else.
#
# THE ROWS ARE ORDERED BY LANDING ORDER ON `origin/<branch>`, MOST RECENTLY
# LANDED FIRST — the position of the commit that ADDED each lane's PAUSED line,
# and never the UTC in it. File order does not reach across two lanes' files,
# and two lanes' UTCs are two clocks: they may be two workstations' (Amendment 7
# gives them no shared order at all) or one workstation's mid-jump — this one
# was observed stepping ±25 s in bursts, and a log commit landed whose content
# carried a UTC 26 s after its own committer date. Git's push serialization is
# the one order both lanes really share, and it is the same arbiter clause (f)
# already uses to decide a race. The UTC stays in the output as INFORMATION, and
# decides nothing.
#
# The rank is the DAG distance from the tip (`rev-list --count <sha>..origin`),
# not a committer date, so it is history order and not a clock either. Swapped
# lanes are few — one per window a swap paused — so one pickaxe per candidate is
# the cheap read. A candidate whose adding commit cannot be found (no remote ref
# here, or the harness's LANES_NO_GIT=1) ranks last, and those fall back to UTC
# order among themselves: an order that is merely unhelpful, never wrong.

# Rule 1 is one act: the three reads, the local line, and the comment that

# lane run with.

# THE SIBLING READS NAME THE OBJECT, NOT ITS DIGITS (Amendment 8). Rule 1's
# reads 2 and 3 searched for the bare slug as a SUBSTRING, and a number is a
# substring of almost everything. Measured live on 2026-09-12 against the
# governing repository, `gh pr list --search 15` answered with PR #16 and PR
# #10 — GitHub had matched the digits inside "**15 of the register's 41 rows**"
# — and `ls-remote | grep 15` answered with a branch whose 40-character sha
# merely contains them, all under the heading "existing work on this object".
# A sibling that does not NAME the object is not evidence about it, and evidence
# that is not evidence is how a lane talks itself out of a claim it should make.
#
# TWO READS, TWO TESTS, because the two inputs are not the same kind of text.
#   pr      `gh pr list`'s rows, which are prose. A number in prose is a
#           number; a REFERENCE is `#<n>`, so the hash is required — and its
#           LEFT side is not bounded, because the canonical spelling of the
#           thing being looked for is `owner/repo#15` and the character before
#           the `#` is a letter. A row whose FIRST field is the number itself
#           is kept too: that is the PR the object IS.
#   branch  `ls-remote`'s refs, which are names. `issue-15-fix` names the
#           object and carries no hash, so the bare number as a whole token is
#           the test — after the leading sha is stripped, so a branch is matched
#           by its name and never by the digits of the commit it points at.
# An OpenSpec change directory has a word for a slug and takes the whole-token
# test in both modes.
#
# AND READ 2 FILTERS OVER THE BODY. `gh pr list`'s columns are number, title,
# branch and state; the reference that makes a PR a sibling is almost always in
# its BODY, which is what GitHub's own search matched and what the columns do
# not carry. Filtering the columns alone dropped PR #16 — the PR for this very
# issue, whose body says `brettheap/new-workstation#15` twice — while a filter
# with the hash optional kept #10 instead. So the body is fetched, flattened to
# one line, used for the test, and cut off again before anything is printed:
# under-reporting a sibling is the direction that lets a lane claim what
# somebody is already working on, and it is the one direction Rule 1 cannot

  # AMENDMENT 8, R-A8-4 — THE UUID APPEND IS CELL-SCOPED.
  #
  # `replace-in-row` refuses unless its anchor occurs exactly once in the WHOLE
  # ROW, and the anchor for a session-cell append is a transcript uuid — which
  # the 6(c) stamp writes into the STATE cell again on every launch (`RESUMED by
  # <uuid> … launching claude --resume <uuid>` — twice more per launched start).
  # Measured against `origin/main` on 2026-09-12, `openRepoProject-1`'s own row
  # carries its current uuid THREE times and its previous one three times, so
  # the single most load-bearing new act in Amendment 8(d) — recording the
  # transcript the harness minted — could not run on the lane the amendment was
  # written for.
  #
  # So the anchor is matched INSIDE THE SESSION CELL and nowhere else, and must
  # occur exactly once THERE. `replace-in-row`'s whole-row rule is unchanged and
  # is still right for what it is for: a state cell says the same thing in two
  # places all the time, and a blind replace there would rewrite the wrong one.
  #
  # AND THE TEXT IS APPENDED AT THE END OF THE CELL, NOT AT THE ANCHOR. This is
  # the second half of the same finding and it is not cosmetic: the cell spells
  # its ids `harness `<uuid>`` — inside backticks — so a replace AT a bare-uuid
  # anchor writes `harness `<uuid> → harness <new>`` and puts the new id inside
  # the old one's code span. The anchor's job is to prove that the cell this
  # checkout holds is the published one the caller read (Amendment 6(b): the
  # cell is a HISTORY, oldest first, and the last id is the lane's current
  # session); the APPEND's job is to add a lineage after all of them. Those are
  # two different positions, and conflating them corrupted the cell.
  #
  # Anything that is not an append — a cell that must really be rewritten — is
  # `replace-in-row`'s business, in front of a person.
