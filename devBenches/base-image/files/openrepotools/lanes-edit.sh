#
# Protocol: ~/.agents/protocols/lane-collision-protocol.md, Rule 9 (registry in
# git) and Rule 10 (workstation designation), Amendment 3, 2026-09-09 — moved
# to the person's workspace repository by Amendment 5, 2026-09-10.
#
# WHERE THE REGISTER LIVES (Amendment 5, 2026-09-10; Amendment 9(a), 2026-09-13)
#   `lanes/LANES.md` on `main` of THE PERSON'S OWN workspace repository — the
#   `<org>/<login>-wip` that `$AGENT_PROTOCOL_ROOT/workspace.yaml` names, which
#   is `opensoft/brett-wip` for the person this file was written for and
#   `opensoft/scott-wip` for the next one. This file names no repository of its
#   own: Amendment 5's second-person clause put a second person's register in a
#   second repository, and Amendment 9 is what made that reachable. Direct commits to
#   `main` are the norm THERE by design: the repository is excluded from the
#   organisation's PR-only ruleset precisely so that a per-edit registry
#   commit can land, which is what Rule 9 requires and what the orphan
#   `lanes` branch of `opensoft/xFactory` used to be for. That branch is
#   RETIRED, and its history came across whole with this file.
#
#   Every path a lane already uses keeps resolving:
#   `~/projects/xFactory/LANES.md` and `~/projects/xFactory/lanes-edit.sh`
#   are symlinks into the checkout, placed by `link-estates`.
#   This script never spells the checkout's own path, and since Amendment 9(a)
#   it no longer derives it from its own location either: it reads
#   `repository:` and `path:` from `$AGENT_PROTOCOL_ROOT/workspace.yaml`, the
#   same pointer file `resume` and `status` already read. This file is an
#   installed command in `~/.local/bin` with no register anywhere near it, so
#   its own directory is evidence about the command and not about a person's
#   data. Failing to find the workspace is a refusal naming
#   `openRepoTools wip init`, never a guess.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   LANES.md is edited by many concurrent lanes on more than one workstation.
#   On 2026-09-08T23:46Z a whole-file write from one session dropped two other
#   lanes' rows and a day of Rule 6 LANDED lines, and there was no history to
#   recover from. Every write now goes through this script (or an equivalent
#   single-line in-place edit followed by commit + pull --rebase + push), so the
#   registry has a history and a lost row is one `git show` away.
#
# HAZARD — `sed -i` REPLACES A SYMLINK WITH A REGULAR FILE.
#   ~/projects/xFactory/LANES.md is a SYMLINK into this worktree. Plain
#   `sed -i` unlinks it and writes a new regular file, silently detaching the
#   registry from git. Use this helper, or `sed -i --follow-symlinks`, or
#   `cat tmp > LANES.md` (a redirect follows the symlink). `>>` appends,
#   `cat`, `cut`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `python open(...,'a')` are all safe.

#
# AMENDMENT 7 — the per-lane object log (`lanes/log/<lane>.md`)
#   lanes-edit.sh log     <VERB> <object> [→|← <payload>] ["<text>"] [--text "<t>"]
#   lanes-edit.sh claim   <object> [--force] [--no-github] [--home owner/repo]
#   lanes-edit.sh release <object> ["<why>"] [--no-github] [--home owner/repo]
#   lanes-edit.sh who     <object> | --lane <lane> | --landing owner/repo
#
# AMENDMENT 8 — swap and restart, the READ side (both read-only, never write)
#   lanes-edit.sh swapped       [<workstation>]
#   lanes-edit.sh session-start                  # the SessionStart hook; JSON on stdin
#
# AMENDMENT 12 — the name guard and the lock (the blocking hook)
#   lanes-edit.sh guard                          # the UserPromptSubmit hook; JSON on stdin
#
#   `guard` is the ONLY verb here that refuses a person's work. It reads the
#   hook's JSON, takes the WINDOW from tmux, the SESSION's own name from the
#   live record and the ROW from `origin/<branch>`, and where the three are not
#   one name it REFUSES THE PROMPT (exit 2) with the triple and the one command
#   that cures it. THE LOCK types `/rename <lane>` into this pane where the name
#   has merely drifted; a PERSON's rename to another lane is an OFFER, answered
#   `yes` or `no` at the next prompt. It is silent and cheap where the three
#   agree, silent outside `$PROJECTS_ROOT` and silent for a subagent's prompt.
#
# AMENDMENT 18(h) — one live process per transcript
#   lanes-edit.sh transcript-holders <uuid>      # every live process carrying it
#
#   A transcript is held by ONE live process; the harness can fork one or resume
#   one twice. This read is what `lane-start` asks before it binds or resumes an
#   id, what `lane-end <lane> --retire <pid>` proves a duplicate with, and what
#   `guard` refuses a prompt on. It sweeps EVERY profile's `sessions/`, because a
#   duplicate's record sits in another profile's — measured four times on
#   2026-09-14.
#
#   A SWAP is a planned stop — a usage reset, a profile switch — and a RESTART
#   is the launch that follows it. The RECORD a swap leaves is not a new file:
#   it is the lane's own `PAUSED` line, payload
#   `swap; window <tmux session>:<index>; workstation <ws>`. A lane is SWAPPED
#   on a workstation when that PAUSED is its LAST lane-kind line — no later
#   RESUMED, STARTED, ENDED or RETIRED — and `swapped` lists those lanes, which
#   is how a restart finds its lane once the new tmux session has lost the
#   window name. `session-start` is the whole output of the SessionStart hook:
#   it resolves the lane from the tmux window name, else from the session id in
#   the hook's JSON, prints ONE block, and ALWAYS exits 0 — a hook that fails
#   is a hook that breaks the session it was meant to orient.
#
# AMENDMENT 17 — the handoff is the swap, and the record names the agent
#   lanes-edit.sh lane-agent      <lane>    # the last record's `agent <name>`
#   lanes-edit.sh lane-transcript <lane>    # its `transcript <id|none>`
#   lanes-edit.sh lane-last       <lane>    # its LAST lane-kind line, as
#                                           # <verb><TAB><utc><TAB><session><TAB><payload>
#   lanes-edit.sh workspace-root            # the workspace repository's path
#   lanes-edit.sh log PAUSED … --utc <UTC>  # date a LATE record by its own field
#
#   Clause (b) gives the `PAUSED` payload two sub-fields beside Amendment
#   11(c)'s `window`, `dir` and `profile`: `agent <name>` — `claude`, `codex`,
#   or the launcher's name for whatever wrote the line, a manifest key (letters,
#   digits, `.`, `_`, `-`) — and `transcript <id|none>`, the agent's own
#   resumable id where it has one. THE WRITER VALIDATES BOTH (`pause_subfields_check`,
#   called from `write_event`) because the log is append-only: a malformed
#   sub-field there is malformed for ever, and `lane-start --agent` launches on
#   what it reads. `swapped` prints them as its sixth and seventh fields, after
#   the five it already had, and a record written before this amendment carries
#   neither — which is EMPTY in that output and 8 from the two reads, never a
#   guess (Amendment 7(i)'s cutover rule).
#
#   `--utc <UTC>` IS FOR THE LATE RECORD AND NOTHING ELSE (adoption act 7): the
#   `PAUSED` a swap never left, written after the fact and dated by the moment
#   the old session ENDED rather than by the clock of the shell writing it. It
#   changes which instant the line NAMES and never where the line goes: the log
#   is append-only and FILE ORDER is what every state read means by "last", so
#   `lane-handoff --late` refuses to write one that would land after the
#   relaunch's `RESUMED` — a lane that is running must never read as paused.
#
#   `--home owner/repo` is an option of all FIVE of `claim`, `release`, `who`,
#   `log` and `lane-end`, for a lane whose log has no STARTED line. All five
#   resolve it AFTER the fetch (R30), because the STARTED line that refuses it
#   may be a peer's and live only on `origin/<branch>`.
#
#   An object is `owner/repo#<n>`, `owner/repo:openspec/changes/<name>`, `#<n>`
#   for the lane's OWN home repo, or `lane:<name>` for the lane-kind lines.
#   `lanes/repos.tsv` (`alias<TAB>owner/repo`) resolves an omitted owner and
#   the register's legacy spellings; an unknown alias is refused, never guessed.
#   A LANE'S HOME GOES THROUGH THE SAME TABLE (R20, Addendum 5) — `lane-start`
#   resolves it before writing STARTED, and every comparison of an object's
#   repository against a home resolves BOTH sides. A home is inherited by every
#   `#<n>` that lane writes, so a legacy org spelling there gave one GitHub
#   issue two object keys and two lanes held it with no collision detected.
#
#   STATE IS PER LANE: a lane's state on an object is its own LAST line naming
#   it, and it HOLDS the object while that verb is open. Open is
#   {CLAIMED, TAKEOVER, OPENED, LANDING, WITHDRAWN}; closed — and it closes
#   only the writing lane's hold — is {RELEASED, CLAIM-LOST, CLOSED, LANDED}.
#
#   THAT APPLIES TO A TAKEOVER TOO (R18, Addendum 5): lane B's TAKEOVER on an
#   object supersedes lane A's CLAIMED only while the TAKEOVER is B's OWN LAST
#   LINE on it. Once B writes RELEASED, CLOSED or LANDED there, A's later
#   CLAIMED holds normally. A TAKEOVER is never removed from an append-only
#   log, so treating one as superseding for ever made a legitimate re-claim
#   invisible: `who` called a held object FREE and `claim` did not refuse the
#   next lane. Known and deliberate: two lanes each ending on a TAKEOVER of one
#   object are BOTH reported as holders — a visible conflict, and not reachable
#   through the helpers, since `claim --force` takes over a stale CLAIMED only.
#
#   AND "LAST" IS THE LAST LINE IN THE FILE (R14, Addendum 4). A lane's log is
#   append-only and single-writer, so the ORDER OF ITS LINES is the order of
#   that lane's writes. No state read here — `lane_objects`, `superseded_by`,
#   PER_LANE_AWK, `who` in any mode, `lane-end`'s refusal, `claim`'s pre-check
#   and its rescan — selects or orders lines by their UTC field. The UTC stays
#   on every line as INFORMATION, and is compared only where a DURATION is the
#   rule: Rule 1's four-hour staleness and Rule 6's thirty minutes, where a few
#   seconds are immaterial. On 2026-09-11 this workstation's realtime clock was
#   observed jumping ±25s in bursts and a log commit landed whose content
#   carried a UTC 26s after its own committer date; a max-UTC read made that
#   lane's newest line invisible. Two workstations never share a clock either.
#
#   `claim` is Rule 1 as one act, and THE RACE IS DECIDED BY WHICH CLAIMED
#   LANDS ON `main` FIRST, never by comparing timestamps: fetch, pre-check
#   against `origin/main`, append, commit, push; on a rebase, rescan, and if
#   another lane's claim is already there, write `CLAIM-LOST` and stop. Git's
#   push serialization is the arbiter between workstations; the `mkdir` mutex
#   below only serializes this one.
#
#   EVERY STATE READ IS OF `origin/<branch>`, AFTER A FETCH — never of the
#   working tree. What has LANDED is what other lanes can see; a working tree
#   can be behind by a peer's whole day. `who`, the pre-check, staleness, the
#   superseded filter, the crossing warning, `lane-end`'s refusal and
#   `lane-start`'s home lookup all read the same source, so they cannot
#   disagree with each other either.
#
#   THE REGISTER'S ROWS ARE READ THE SAME WAY (R19, Addendum 5). The session
#   cell, the handoff path and the workstation column come from
#   `git show origin/<branch>:lanes/LANES.md`; nothing in `who` reads the
#   working tree. THE ONE EXCEPTION IS THE `live-holder` SUBCOMMAND, and only
#   its id SET (R25, Addendum 6): it is the published row's union this
#   checkout's, because a session stamps its uuid on the row with
#   `replace-in-row` and that write is a LOCAL COMMIT until its push lands —
#   read from `origin` alone the rename gate would not see the uuid of the very
#   session it is being asked to rename over, would answer 8, and `lane-start`
#   would take the name. That is what mints `<lane> (2)` (AGENTS.md rule 7).
#   Liveness fails closed, so an id `origin` has not seen is a reason to refuse
#   a rename, never to allow one, and nothing that PRINTS uses the union.
#
#   A LANDED CLOSES THE LANDING IT ANSWERS (R17, Addendum 5): `who --landing`
#   pairs them by (lane, PR) in FILE ORDER and keys the result on
#   (lane, repository, PR). Most of the register's LANDED lines carry no
#   `into <repo> main` clause, and keying those on the repository they name
#   reported 232 phantom merge holds where one was real.
#
# EXIT CODES — every subcommand, one table, no two meanings on one number
#   0  done
#   1  environment (no register, no writer)
#   2  refusal: bad arguments, the object is held, an unknown alias, a
#      checkout that cannot be rebased, — Amendment 15 — a register holding
#      two rows whose lane names differ only by case, which every writer and
#      `canon-lane` refuse until 15(d)'s merge, or AMENDMENT 12's BLOCKED
#      PROMPT. SIX MEANINGS ON ONE NUMBER, and they
#      stay readable only because of where each can occur: bad arguments to a
#      subcommand that predates Amendment 11; `register-row`'s "not lane-shaped";
#      AN UNKNOWN SUBCOMMAND (the `*)` arm below), which is how a caller detects
#      a helper predating the amendment that added the read it asked for; and
#      Amendment 11's container refusal. The last is on WRITERS ONLY (the
#      dispatcher guard), so no READ can return it and clause (h)'s
#      fall-to-the-next-rung rule is unaffected by it.
#      THE SIXTH IS NOT THIS FILE'S NUMBER AT ALL: 2 is what a `UserPromptSubmit`
#      hook must exit to BLOCK a prompt (code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks), so
#      `guard` spends the one number the harness reads, and every refusal it
#      makes — a mismatch, an unreadable read, a pending offer's question and
#      its answer — is that 2. `guard` never exits anything else but 0.
#  64  usage — a caller's bad arguments to one of the reads Amendment 11 added
#      (`window-lane`, `lane-dir`, `lane-profile`, `last-session`, `forks`,
#      `workstation`, `fetch-age`, `lanes`, `session-lane`, and `swapped`, which
#      took it first), and to Amendment 15's `canon-lane`, which takes the same
#      contract because its four callers sit in front of a launch as those do. IT WAS IN NO TABLE AT ALL until this round (F-X16), while
#      being the code the contract gives every one of those reads.
#
#      WHY A SECOND USAGE CODE RATHER THAN 2. A read in front of a launch has to
#      tell "you called me wrong" from "this helper has never heard of you" —
#      and the second of those IS a 2, emitted by the `*)` arm, on every
#      workstation until adoption act 3's install reaches it. One number cannot
#      carry both without the caller guessing, so the newer reads spend a number
#      of their own and the older half of this file keeps 2 where it always was.
#      Clause (h)'s table is the contract for which read uses which.
#   3  the edit is never a permanent loss, but this attempt cannot confirm
#      whether it also reached origin. THREE CAUSES (Copilot round 3 on #50,
#      5203261904, naming the other two this row used to leave out): a
#      rebase conflict this attempt could not resolve — not pushed BY THIS
#      ATTEMPT; a later write from this checkout may already carry it to
#      origin, so LOOK by CONTENT before you retry (round 4, 5203455553:
#      SHA ancestry alone misses a peer's rebase of it, which changes the
#      hash but not the patch); `git_timeout_die`'s network timeout on a
#      push OR a pull, where a hung one often already landed; or six
#      attempts exhausted because a peer's own uncommitted file blocks
#      every rebase.
#   4  the mutex could not be taken within 60s
#   5  an edit moved more than one line and was refused — or, Amendment 15, a
#      lane's object log could not be renamed to the row's own spelling
#   6  git add / commit / push failed
#   7  CLAIM-LOST — another lane's claim landed on main first (`claim` only)
#   8  no record — `who` found nothing; `lane-objects` has no log file for the
#      lane; `live-holder` READ this workstation's session records and none of
#      them holds it; `swapped` found no lane swapped on the workstation;
#      `window-session` found no live session in the window. A read that could
#      not be performed is never 8 (R22). `session-start` never exits 8, or
#      anything but 0: it is a hook. `guard` never exits 8 either — it is a hook
#      too, and a BLOCKING one, so its two codes are 0 and 2 (see 2 above).
#
# --no-sweep (DEFAULT, added 2026-09-09 after 0d84d34/a1f2438 swept another
#   lane's uncommitted hand edit into an unrelated commit): every mutating
#   subcommand checks, before making its own edit, whether LANES.md is
#   already dirty. If it is, that content is someone else's — never this
#   invocation's — so it is committed FIRST, on its own, as
#   `LANES(pre-existing@<workstation>): capture an uncommitted registry edit
#   (row <lane>)`, before this invocation's own edit is made and committed.
#   A WARNING (with `git diff --stat` and the first 200 chars of every
#   changed line) always prints first. This never fails the call — the
#   write still goes through. Amendment 7's `log`, `claim` and `release` take
#   the same capture for the REGISTER between the two halves of their
#   dirty-checkout guard, which is why a peer's half-written `lanes/LANES.md`
#   does not refuse them (Addendum 3, R11); any OTHER modified tracked file
#   still does, and is refused before the capture rather than after it.
# --sweep — the old behaviour: leave the pre-existing content staged so it
#   lands inside this invocation's own commit. Still warns exactly as above,
#   and appends " + sweeps uncommitted edit to row <lane>" to the commit
#   subject, so the sweep is never silent.
# `commit` has no edit of its own to separate from a pre-existing one — its
#   job IS to wrap whatever is already dirty. It instead warns and appends
#   the same " + sweeps uncommitted edit to row <lane>" note when the dirty
#   content touches a row other than the caller's own $LANES_LANE.

# --- THE WORKSPACE REPOSITORY (lane-collision-protocol Amendment 9(a)) -------
#
# The person's data — the register `lanes/LANES.md`, the object logs
# `lanes/log/`, the handoffs, the manifests `park` writes, and a
# `lanes/repos.tsv` override — is found through
# `$AGENT_PROTOCOL_ROOT/workspace.yaml`, and NEVER from this file's own
# location. `resume:466` and `status:1673` already read that same file under
# that same name, and Amendment 9(a) mints no second one: a second way to find
# it is a second answer.
#
# Deriving it from here stopped being POSSIBLE the moment this became an
# installed regular file in `~/.local/bin` with no register anywhere near it,
# and it stopped being WANTED for a subtler reason: a file's location on disk
# is evidence about the file, not about a person's data.
#
# THESE FOUR FUNCTIONS ARE A DELIBERATE COPY, byte for byte, across
# `lanes-edit.sh`, `lane-start`, `lane-end` and `link-estates` — the same trade
# openRepoTools already makes for its own fetch shim (`openRepoTools:93-100`).
# A shared `lanes-common.sh` would be a TENTH file for `--install` to place and
# a broken helper the first time somebody copied only some of them. Each of
# these is one file a person has on PATH.
#
# FAILING TO FIND IT IS A REFUSAL, NEVER A GUESS. No file, no `path:`, no
# `repository:`, or a `path:` that is not the root of a checkout of the
# `repository:` named beside it → the caller refuses, exit 1 — the code
# `lanes-edit.sh` has always used for *registry not found* — with the fix
# named: `openRepoTools wip init`. Nothing here ever creates that file, writes
# a register, or falls back to a path derived from its own location. THE
# CHECKOUT TEST IS NEW: nothing validated it before this, so a `path:` pointing
# at some other repository used to be accepted and now is not.
#
# `LANES_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is the test seam and the only override — the seam
# `lane-start` already spelled for handoff resolution, widened to the whole
# question so `test_lane_helpers.sh` can point every helper at one sandbox.
# --- BEGIN shared workspace resolver (Amendment 9(a)) ----------------------
# BYTE-IDENTICAL IN ALL FOUR LANE HELPERS, and held there by
# `tests/test_repo_hygiene.py`. The estate commands carry the same discipline
# for their own estate resolver and for the same reason its guard gives: a
# drifted copy is TWO ANSWERS to one question, and "where is this person's
# workspace" is exactly the question Amendment 9(a) exists to give one answer
# to. Edit it in one file and the test names the other three.

# THE WORKSTATION'S NAME IS READ, NEVER INVENTED — AND NEVER `hostname` INSIDE A
# CONTAINER (lane-collision-protocol Amendment 11, ratified decision 8(d), as
# corrected by A11 Addendum 3's `R-A11-14`).
#
# WHAT WENT WRONG. `opensoft/brett-wip` `origin/main` carries SIX lines in
# `lanes/log/openRepoProject-1.md` whose workstation is a container id — five
# `@0e7d1a79a07e`, one `@55cceb3e5bc9` — in an append-only file, written by every
# writer inside that container and not only by Evidence 6's fork. A row on a
# workstation that does not exist is a row no reader can match, no crossing can
# detect and no `swapped <ws>` can answer for; and the log is never rewritten, so
# each one is wrong for ever.
#
# WHO OWNS THE VALUE. `R-A11-14`: the **workBenches launcher**, which runs on the
# host and exports `LANES_WORKSTATION=<the host's own hostname -s>` into every
# session AND every container it starts, beside the `CLAUDE_PROFILE_NAME` it
# already exports. These helpers READ it. They do not write it, they do not
# derive it from a second file, and THEY NEVER SUBSTITUTE A PLACEHOLDER: an
# `@unknown-workstation` is the same defect one field along from the `unknown`
# clause (e) refuses in the session field, and the rejected alternative — a
# `workstation:` key in `workspace.yaml` — is a SECOND PLACE FOR THE TRUTH TO BE
# WRONG beside the variable the launcher already sets.
#
# THE THREE ANSWERS, as `<name><TAB><source>`:
#
#   seam              `$LANES_WORKSTATION` is set. This is the ordinary case
#                     wherever the launcher started the session.
#   hostname          no seam, and this is NOT a container: `hostname -s`, which
#                     is what the seam has defaulted to since Amendment 6 and
#                     what every row written before this rung was written by.
#   container-unset   no seam, and this IS a container. The NAME still answers,
#                     because a read in front of every launch may not refuse —
#                     it will simply match nothing, which is the honest answer —
#                     but every WRITER refuses, exit 2, naming the variable and
#                     the launcher that sets it.
#
# IT ANSWERS AS A PAIR, AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. A caller reads the name
# with `$(lanes_workstation)`, which is a COMMAND SUBSTITUTION and therefore a
# subshell: a global the function set there dies with it. The source is on the
# same line as the name, which is the only way out of a subshell there is.
#
#   $LANES_IN_CONTAINER   1 or 0, forcing the probe. THE TEST SEAM, and nothing
#                         else sets it: the suite must be able to exercise both
#                         halves of this rule on one host, and the host it runs
#                         on is a container exactly when it is.

# ------------------------------------------- AMENDMENT 8, ruling (h): THE
# WRITER NEVER BLOCKS THE ESTATE.
#
# On 2026-09-12 at about 01:44Z an ssh `git-receive-pack` hung for five minutes
# AFTER its push had already landed, and `lanes-edit.sh append-row-status` sat
# inside it holding the mutex for the whole five minutes. Every lane on Eagle
# that wanted to write a row waited behind a lock whose holder was blocked on a
# socket, and the estate only moved again when the ssh was killed by hand.
#
# So every git call that touches the NETWORK — push, pull, fetch, ls-remote —
# runs under a timeout, and a timeout is not a failure to retry: it is a
# refusal to hold the mutex any longer. The helper aborts any rebase it started,
# releases the lock, prints how to find out whether the push landed anyway, and
# exits 3 with the edit safe in a local commit.
#
# `LANES_GIT_TIMEOUT` is the budget in seconds (default 60; 0 disables the
# bound). `LANES_GIT` is the binary, so a test can hand these calls — and ONLY
# these calls — a git that hangs, without shadowing git for the rest of the

# commit_push "<subject>" [<pathspec>...] — the pathspecs default to the
# register alone, which is every caller that predates Amendment 7. A LANDING
# or LANDED writes TWO (the register and the lane's log) so that both halves
# of one act land in one commit and no reader ever sees half of it.
# AMENDMENT 15 — A CASE-ONLY RENAME IS STAGED IN THE INDEX AND COMMITTED FROM
# IT, because a PATH-LIMITED commit cannot record one at all on a
# case-INSENSITIVE filesystem — which is what this repository's macOS job runs
# on. `ensure_log` renames a lane's log to the register row's spelling and
# hands the OLD path in beside the new one. Three things are true there, and
# together they leave exactly one way through:
#
#   * `git add -- <old> <new>` under git's own `core.ignorecase=true` matches
#     both pathspecs to the ONE index entry and stages a MODIFICATION under the
#     old name, so the rename never reaches the commit. Measured on the macOS
#     job of openRepoTools#41 at `48f2111`: fifteen red assertions, the first
#     of them *"the rename landed in the WRITE's own commit"*, whose
#     `git log -- <the canonical path>` came back EMPTY.
#   * The same `add` under `core.ignorecase=false` is no better, and is worse:
#     the OPERATING SYSTEM still resolves `lanes/log/repocase-1.md` to the file
#     now named `repoCase-1.md`, so git stages the old entry as MODIFIED and
#     the new path as a SECOND entry. One file on disk, two paths in the tree —
#     and every checkout after it reports the one it cannot materialise as
#     deleted, so the writes behind it are refused (2) for a dirty checkout
#     they did not make. Measured at `e35f2a8` and `928908a`: eleven red
#     assertions, all of them behind `lanes/log/repocase-1.md` reported dirty.
#   * `git commit -- <paths>` is `--only`: it builds the tree from HEAD and the
#     WORKING TREE of those paths, disregarding what is staged. So an index
#     that holds the rename exactly is thrown away by the commit anyway, and
#     the old path — which the OS still resolves — comes back in the tree.
#
# So the old entry is dropped from the INDEX by its exact path, where no
# filesystem is consulted at all; the NEW path alone is added; and the commit
# is made from the index rather than from a pathspec.
# `update-index --force-remove` is the one git verb that removes an entry
# without asking the filesystem whether the file is still there, and it is a
# no-op on a path the index does not hold — so a log that was never committed
# renames just as quietly. The index commit is FAIL-CLOSED: anything staged
# that is not one of this write's own pathspecs refuses (6) instead of riding
# along, which is the guarantee the `--only` pathspec was there to give.
#
# `-c core.ignorecase=false` stays on every call that takes `CP_PATHS`, because
# a pathspec that means one thing to `add` and another to `diff` is the same
# defect one line along: with the old entry already gone it is what makes `add`
# record the new path in the spelling the code computed rather than the one the
# index used to hold. It narrows nothing else — these paths are this file's own,
# `lanes/LANES.md` and `lanes/log/<lane>.md`, spelled by the code that computes

      # workstation, so the very next write out of it pulls this dangling
      # commit onto its own and pushes both together — three of the four
      # "rebase conflict … nothing was pushed" lines seen on Eagle in one
      # hour named a commit that was ALREADY on origin by the time anyone
      # read them. LOOK before you reset or redo anything — by ANCESTRY
      # (Copilot round 2 on #50, 5203033893): a log capped at a few entries
      # can bury this commit below the window while it stays an ancestor, the
      # moment four or more later writes land ahead of it.
      # ROUND 3 (Copilot 5203261904): `fetch && merge-base ... && echo A ||
      # echo B` is left-associative — a FAILED fetch also falls to the `||`
      # and prints the SAME "not-there" a genuine non-ancestor does, so a
      # stale or unreachable origin would silently wave the reset/redo path
      # through. Fetch is now its own line, checked before anything else.
      # ROUND 4 (Copilot 5203455553): SHA ancestry is the wrong test — the
      # very write this whole recovery exists to catch (a peer's own
      # `commit_push` pulling THIS dangling commit and rebasing it onto a
      # newer base, per the very next branch above) gives it a NEW sha, so
      # `merge-base --is-ancestor $cp_sha …` answers "not-there" even once
      # the CONTENT is published. `git cherry` compares by PATCH, not by
      # sha, so a rebase that only replays the same change (no real
      # conflict) is still found. Measured against a real bare repo: a
      # commit rebased by a peer this way answers `not-there` under
      # `merge-base --is-ancestor` and `-` (found, equivalent) under
      # `git cherry` — verified for the genuinely-absent case too (`+`) and

# much of the day — the register takes ~500 commits a day and a half-written
# row is what one of them looks like a second before it lands — so refusing
# every `claim`, `log` and `release` on it would push lanes to stop using the
# tool, and the pre-existing capture already exists precisely to make that
# state safe to rebase over. So: capture FIRST, exactly as every register
# write has done since --no-sweep (the warning included), and let the guard
# re-test the checkout afterwards.
#
# Only when the register is NOT one of this write's own pathspecs: a LANDING
# or a LANDED commits it itself, and the ordinary handle_preexisting call
# covers it there, --sweep included. There is nothing to sweep a register edit
# INTO when this commit does not touch the register, so this capture is always
# its own commit whatever --sweep says.
#
# It is reached only AFTER write_event's first guard, so it never commits on
# behalf of a write that is about to refuse: a checkout dirty in anything ELSE
# is refused before the lock and before this runs, and a refusal that had
# already committed a peer's register edit would be a refusal that wrote.

# ======================================================== Amendment 7 ======
#
# THE PER-LANE OBJECT LOG.
#
#   lanes/log/<lane>.md — one file per lane, append-only, line 1 a header,
#   every other line an EVENT. This helper is the only writer, for the same
#   reason it is the register's only writer. One file per lane is also what
#   makes two workstations safe: two lanes writing at once touch two files.
#
#   <VERB> — lane <lane>, session <uuid>@<ws>, <UTC>, <object>[ → <payload>][ — <free text>]
#
#   The verb is ONE token. The first four fields are separated by `, `. The
#   OBJECT token contains no space and no comma; everything after it up to
#   ` — ` is payload, whose sub-fields are separated by `; ` and whose refs
#   are space-separated.
#
#   STATE IS PER LANE. A lane's state on an object is that lane's LAST line
#   naming it — the last such line IN THE FILE, never the largest UTC (R14);
#   the lane HOLDS the object when that verb is in the OPEN set; the object is
#   HELD when any lane holds it. There is no index file: a read fetches and
#   greps, because 45 lanes' logs together are smaller than one of the
#   register's rows.
#
#   LANES.md is unchanged. Its rows stay its rows and its Rule 6 LANDING /
#   LANDED lines stay where every lane already reads them as the merge hold —
#   which is why `who --landing` reads THOSE and not the logs. A LANDING or
#   LANDED writes both files in one commit, with two pathspecs.

# AMENDMENT 15 — THE LOG FILE IS `lanes/log/<canonical>.md`, AND A FILE OF
# ANOTHER CASE IS STILL THIS LANE'S LOG.
#
# The log's file name was lowercased from the start, which is exactly why the
# 2026-09-13 incident produced TWO ROWS AND ONE LOG: `openXfactory-2` and
# `openxfactory-2` had always shared `lanes/log/openxfactory-2.md`. The real
# register still carries `lanes/log/openxfactory-4.md` beside the row
# `openxfactory-4` — the same spelling, nothing to do — and the historical
# mismatch is the shape these two functions exist for. READERS find the file
# whatever its case; the first WRITE renames it to the canonical spelling, once,
# inside its own commit (`ensure_log` below).
#
# `ls` and one `awk`, not a `$(lc …)` per file: `lanes/log/` carries a file per
# lane of the estate and this is asked on the path a person is waiting on.
#
# AND THE `--` STAYS (Copilot round 3 on openRepoTools#41, DECLINED with a
# measurement). It was read as a macOS defect — *"BSD `ls` rejects `--`, and the
# suppressed error makes every case-insensitive log scan empty"* — which would
# mean no first write ever renames anything on the one platform this amendment's
# rename exists for. BSD `ls` ends its options at `--` through `getopt(3)`, as
# every POSIX utility does, and `tests-macos` has been GREEN on the two
# assertions that can only pass if this scan finds a file of another case there:
# the rename recorded inside the write's own commit, and `lane-start`'s own
# `repo repocase → repoCase` out of the twin scan at `lane-start:677`. The suite
# asserts the parse itself as well, on every platform. Dropping `--` would hand
# a directory whose name begins with `-` back to `ls` as flags and change
# nothing else.

# The PUBLISHED path of a lane's log, found the same way — the canonical path
# where `origin/<branch>` has no file of another case, so a lane with no log at
# all still reads as the pre-cutover 8 rather than as a failure.
#
# TWO PATHS DIFFERING ONLY BY CASE ARE A REFUSAL AND NOT A CHOICE (Copilot round
# 4 on openRepoTools#41). The `exit` after the first match read a tree holding
# BOTH `lanes/log/repocase-1.md` and `lanes/log/repoCase-1.md` as though it held
# one, and every reader behind it — `lane_log_events`, `lane_log_exists`,
# `last-session`, the listing's per-lane facts — then consumed whichever `ls-tree`
# happened to name first and DROPPED the other file's lines without saying so.
# That is two logs for one lane, the state 15(d)'s hand merge exists for, and an
# append-only history half of which is invisible is worse than a refusal. Counted
# and REFUSED (2) naming both, in `canon_lane`'s own shape — it RETURNS rather
# than exits, because every caller takes it with `$( )`.
#
# AND THE WORKING TREE ANSWERS WHERE `origin` HAS NOTHING. The fallback was the
# canonical path outright, which is a path that need not exist: a lane whose log
# is still spelled the old way and has never been pushed has ONE file on disk and
# this named another. `claim`'s dirty-checkout exemption is computed from it, so

# The register, read the same way — `who --landing` is a state read about a

# CACHED FOR THE LIFE OF ONE PROCESS, and Amendment 11's listing is the reason.
# The published register is a 1 MB file and this is a `git show` of it; every
# `row_of_lane`, `lane_named_ci`, `lane_of_session` and `lane_workstation` call
# makes one. A single lane's act makes a handful and nobody noticed — but
# `lanes` asks about EVERY lane in the register, so the same megabyte was being
# re-rendered dozens of times for one listing a person is waiting on.
#
# IT IS SAFE BECAUSE NOTHING INSIDE ONE INVOCATION MOVES IT. `origin/<branch>`
# is advanced by `log_sync`, which every subcommand runs BEFORE it reads, and by
# `commit_push`, which runs AFTER the last read of a write path — so the ref a
# process reads is fixed for as long as that process reads it. The one act that
# would break that assumption is a second `log_sync` mid-read, and there is
# none; `log_sync` clears this cache anyway, so a caller that adds one gets the
# fresh answer rather than a stale one.
# AND IN A FILE AS WELL AS A VARIABLE (A11 Addendum 4 ruling 12). The variable
# serves one shell; every caller of `row_of_lane`, `lane_workstation` and
# `session_ids_of_lane` reaches it through `$( … )`, which is a SUBSHELL, so the
# variable cache was rebuilt — a `git show` of 1.1 MB — by all four of the
# per-lane reads the listing makes, for every lane. The file survives the
# subshell that wrote it, so the megabyte is rendered once per process.

# lane's log is append-only and single-writer, so its line order IS that lane's
# write order; a clock is not. It was a max-UTC read here that made a LANDED
# invisible behind the LANDING it closed, on the day this workstation's clock
# was jumping ±25s. `pos()` is the line's address — its file and its line
# number, zero-padded so that one string comparison orders both.
# AMENDMENT 15 — KEYED ON THE LANE LOWER-CASED. The key decides how many rows
# come out of here, and the ROW is the whole line, so the spelling a reader sees
# is still the one the winning line carried. Keyed on the raw `$2`, a lane whose
# log spells it two ways emitted TWO rows for ONE lane — and `claim`-s rival
# test, which excludes its OWN row from this set, then met its own earlier
# CLAIMED as a stranger and refused the lane its own object (Copilot round 1 on

#
# WHERE THE TIME WENT, measured on a copy of the live register (46 rows, 15
# logs) before any of this was written: `lanes` took 14 m 30 s wall and ~23
# CPU-minutes. Not the register, and not the logs — a `git show` of the 1.1 MB
# register is 11 ms and the fifteen logs are one cached pass. It was THIS: 564
# session records on this workstation, each read with `cat` and then four or
# five `jstr`/`jnum` calls that are FOUR PROCESSES EACH (`printf | grep | head |
# sed`) — about twenty processes per record, eleven thousand per scan — and both
# scans were rebuilt FOR EVERY LANE, because `live_session_ids` and `fork_map`
# cached into a VARIABLE and every caller invoked them inside `$( … )`, which is
# a subshell whose variables die with it.
#
# So: the parse becomes ONE awk over every record file, and the caches become
# FILES, which a subshell's build leaves behind for its parent.
#
# `jstr` and `jnum` ARE REPRODUCED HERE RATHER THAN CALLED, and the reproduction
# is exact: `jstr` is the first `"key":"…"` whose value holds no `"`, `jnum` the
# first `"key":` followed immediately by a digit. Both are `grep -o … | head -n1`
# on the whole blob, so both take the FIRST occurrence and neither is anchored.
# A record is read the same way by either path, and `record_is_live` still makes
# the liveness decision in shell, on the fields this hands it.

# ------------------------------------- AMENDMENT 8, ruling (g): WHOSE session
#
# Three facts about this estate's records, every one of them observed on
# 2026-09-12 while `lane-start` was refusing the very window that held the lane:
#
#   1. THE HARNESS EXPORTS `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` into every shell a session
#      runs — so a `lane-start` that a session runs already knows its own
#      transcript id without asking the filesystem anything. That is the
#      cheapest and the most certain test there is, and it comes first.
#   2. ONE SESSION WRITES MORE THAN ONE RECORD. Beside the interactive process
#      in the pane the harness runs a companion: `kind: bg`, no `tmux`, no
#      `nameSource`, its own pid, and THE SAME `sessionId`. Records that share a
#      `sessionId` are one session, not a queue of rival holders, and there is
#      no contest between them to win.
#   3. A RECORD MAY CARRY NO `tmux` AT ALL. The pane's interactive record
#      usually has one, the companion never does, and the harness has been seen
#      to write none for a process plainly in a window. "No target" is not "no
#      window": it is a missing observation, and the process tree holds the
#      answer the record failed to write down.
#
# What those three produced: `live_holder` returned the COMPANION — its
# `sessionId` matched the row, its pid was alive, and carrying no `nameSource`
# it survived the name test — reported its target as `none`, and `lane-start`
# read "not this window" and refused the session that was running the command:
#
#   lane openRepoProject-1 is live in session c5701b54… (tmux none);
#   take openRepoProject-2 or resume that window
#
# The orphaned idle holder from the PREVIOUS profile was a real find and was
# correctly retired under Amendment 6(d); this one was the same shape read
# wrongly. The difference between them is not recency and never was — it is
# whether the process is in THIS pane's tree.

# A `kind: bg` record is a COMPANION: never a holder, never a rival, skipped by
# every read that asks who holds a lane or what is in a window. Only
# `interactive` records hold a lane; a record from a harness too old to say
# carries no `kind` at all and is read as interactive, because that is the only
# thing those harnesses ever wrote.

# R22 — IT FAILS CLOSED AT THE SOURCE. Three answers, and they are distinct:
#   0  a live record holds the lane (the row is printed)
#   8  the records were READ, and none of them does
#   1  the records could not be read — a permissions or IO fault
#
# AND ON 0 IT SAYS WHOSE (Amendment 8, ruling (g)). The fifth field is the
# verdict — `here`, `elsewhere` or `orphan` — because the caller that has to act
# on it cannot work it out from the `tmux` column: a record with no target is
# not a record in no window, and `lane-start` refusing on that string is what
# refused this lane its own window. `here` beats `elsewhere` beats `orphan`, and
# a record with no target whose SESSION also wrote a windowed record is that
# same session seen twice, not a second holder — it is dropped, never ranked.
# `lane-start` renames a window on 8 and REFUSES on anything else, so collapsing
# a failed read into 8 is exactly how a running lane loses its address: the
# rename mints `<lane> (2)` (AGENTS.md rule 7). The first version returned 1 for
# both, which is the same fault one layer up; hardening the CALLER left this

# -------------------------------- AMENDMENT 8(f), R-A8-6: the ORPHANED HOLDERS
#
# A row's session cell is a HISTORY, and its EARLIER ids are history rather than
# alternatives — but a live process can still be holding one, which is Amendment
# 6(d)'s orphan and, on this lane, the reason the `/resume` picker offered two
# transcripts of which neither was the lane. `live_holder` answers about the
# lane's holder, one record, picked; this answers about ALL the earlier ids, and
# it answers to be READ.
#
# IT NAMES THEM AND DOES NOTHING ELSE. Retiring is `kill <pid>`, printed by the
# caller and run by a person: ending somebody's process is not a boundary
# script's act — an idle background session is exactly the shape of thing that
# turns out to be somebody's long-running job — and clause (f) rules it the
# operator's, for the same reason clause (a)'s step 3 pushes nobody's work for
# them.
#
# IDLE means a LIVE record (Amendment 6's three tests: a status that is not
# ended, a pid that is alive, a `procStart` that still matches) which is NOT a
# session in a window: a `kind: bg` companion, or a record carrying no `tmux`

# asks "which live session is in THIS WINDOW", and the two answers differ in
# exactly the case Amendment 8 exists for. The harness mints a new transcript
# uuid without anybody acting — a `/clear` does it (Amendment 6, fact 4), and so
# did the 2026-09-12 usage reset that carried this lane's conversation into
# `4a91f1dc…` while its row still ended on `09dd34d1…`. That id is in no row, so
# `live_holder` cannot see it and answers 8, "this lane is parked", about the
# conversation sitting in the window it was asked about. Keyed on the WINDOW
# instead, the record is found, and `lane-start` appends its uuid to the cell
# before it stamps — which is what makes the next resume land in the right

# read at all.
# WHERE SEVERAL LIVE RECORDS NAME ONE WINDOW, IDENTITY DECIDES — NOT RECENCY
# (Amendment 8, ruling (g); this replaces the first version's "the most recently

#   tier 3  its `sessionId` is `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, which the harness
#           exported into this very shell — when the window asked about is this
#           one. Nothing beats a session naming itself.
#   tier 2  its pid is this pane's process or below it — again only for this
#           window. This is what lets a record with NO `tmux` be found: the
#           harness does not always write the target down, and a record without
#           one is not thereby in no window.
#   tier 1  its `tmux` field names the window. The fast path, and the only test
#           available for a window that is not this one.
#
# `updatedAt` breaks a tie WITHIN a tier and nowhere else, so the answer never
# depends on directory order. It cannot be the rule itself: it is a LIVENESS
# HEARTBEAT, and the idle companion beside a working session heartbeats later
# than the session does — in the 2026-09-12 records the companion's `updatedAt`
# was 1789235975177 against the interactive record's 1789235958137, so "the

# ------------------------------------------------------------ the row, read
#
# R19 — FROM `origin/<branch>`, LIKE EVERY OTHER STATE READ. These four reads
# (the row itself, its session cell, its handoff path and its workstation
# column) were the last ones taking the WORKING TREE, and `print_holder_detail`
# is built entirely out of them — so `who` routinely answered with a current log
# and a stale row: a holder recorded on the other workstation read `NOT LIVE`
# because a peer's UNCOMMITTED edit to column 3 said `Eagle`, and a row that
# exists only on `origin/main` was not seen at all, losing the resume uuid and
# the handoff path, which are the two things `who` exists to hand over. Nothing
# in `who` reads the working tree now.

# AMENDMENT 15 — `tolower` ON BOTH SIDES, like every other lookup of a lane
# name in this file. A caller reaches these two through `canon_lane`, so the
# name arriving here is already the ROW's own spelling; the comparison is
# case-insensitive anyway, because a caller that did not canonicalise must not
# silently read "this lane has no row" about a lane that has one.

# ====================================================== AMENDMENT 15 =======
#
# THE RESOLVER. **A lane name is compared CASE-INSENSITIVELY wherever a name is
# looked up, and the spelling the register row carries is canonical** — it is
# what the window is named, what the session is named, what the log file is
# called, and what every line and stamp writes. A name typed in another case
# RESOLVES to it and is never written as typed.
#
# Every spelling the PUBLISHED register carries for a name, from
# `origin/<branch>` like every other state read (R19). `lane_named_ci` below is
# the same question asked for one answer and no refusal — it is the hook's read
# and the hook never refuses — so the two are one parse in two shapes rather
# than two rules.
#
# AND A THIRD SHAPE SINCE AMENDMENT 12: the prompt guard asks this one because
# it COUNTS. `canon_lane` below answers a caller that wants a name back and
# refuses two with `note` + 2 in this file's own voice; the guard has to print
# its triple FIRST and then say what is wrong, in its own shape, so it takes the
# spellings from here and makes the refusal itself. One parse, three readings,
# and no second rule about what a lane name is.

  # under 7(b)'s own grammar. (The amendment spells that example under a home
  # directory; it is spelled with a neutral root here because
  # `test_no_committed_file_names_a_host_absolute_path` refuses a `/home/<name>/`
  # path in any tracked file, and a rule that holds for a real path holds for an
  # example of one.) One ref under
  # 7(b) — so `quote_subfield` puts a `"` into the payload deliberately and a `"`
  # refusal here would refuse the very shape the clause mandates. The `"` belongs
  # in the per-VALUE fences, where it is, and not in the whole-payload one.

# lane and PR that is still unmatched, and the pair’s repository is the
# LANDING’s — while the RESULT still keys on (lane, repository, PR), which is
# what keeps a LANDED on one repository from closing a LANDING on another.
# AND A LANDED THAT NAMES A REPOSITORY PREFERS A LANDING ON THAT REPOSITORY
# (R24, Addendum 6). Only a LANDED with NO `into <repo> main` clause takes the
# most recent unmatched LANDING regardless — it has said nothing about where it
# landed, so the LANDING is the only thing that can say. One that DOES name a
# repository takes the most recent unmatched LANDING naming the same one, and
# is reported as an `unpaired LANDED` — closing nothing — only when there is no
# such LANDING at all. Without the preference, a lane with two LANDINGs open on
# ONE PR number in two repositories that lands the EARLIER one, naming its
# repository, was unpaired and both holds stayed open until the second landed.
# The answer is identical everywhere else, including the (lane, repository, PR)
# result key: a LANDED on one repository still closes no LANDING on another.
#
# The repository is lower-cased IN THE KEY ONLY: the register spells one
# repository four ways in a week, and a LANDED spelled `OpsxFactory` must still
# close a LANDING spelled `opsXfactory`.
#
# AND BOTH SIDES GO THROUGH `lanes/repos.tsv` FIRST (R29, Addendum 7). Case is
# only half of it: the register writes `OpsxFactory` and `opensoft/OpsxFactory`
# for ONE repository — 23 Rule 6 lines against 70 at `8f9c04d` — and
# `codexFactory`, `codeXfactory/codexFactory` and `opensoft/codexFactory` for
# another. Compared literally, a LANDED spelled one way does not close the
# LANDING spelled the other: it reads as an `unpaired LANDED`, the hold stays
# open, and over-reporting a merge hold is the direction that stalls other
# lanes' merges. So every `into <repo> main` is resolved AS IT IS PARSED, which
# makes the pairing, R24's preference and the (lane, repository, PR) result key
# agree by construction — the key's repository is the canonical spelling, and
# an alias the table does not know keeps its own, case-blind like every other.
#
# WHAT THAT IS WORTH TODAY, measured read-only over `origin/main` at `6fa966b`:
# the VERDICT does not move — 1 open LANDING (lane browser-ui-repair's PR #401,
# genuinely in flight) and 0 unpaired LANDED, before this change and after it.
# No (lane, PR) pair in the register mixes its spellings YET, so this is a
# guard and not a repair, and it is worth saying so rather than claiming a hold
# it did not clear. What it does move there is the KEY: 17 result-key spellings
# collapse to the 11 repositories they name, and two LANDINGs a retry spelled
# two ways are one hold instead of two.
#
# The table is handed in through the ENVIRONMENT, as `LANES_RULE6_ALIASES`,
# one `<lowercased alias>\037<owner/repo>` per line — because awk cannot read
# `repos.tsv` for itself here (this program's stdin is the register) and
# because `awk -v`, which is where it used to go, carries ONE LINE: see
# `who_landing` for what a many-line `-v` does on macOS's awk.
#
# BOTH LAYERS, SHIPPED FIRST (Amendment 9(b)). This is the second reader of the
# table — `alias_lookup` is the other — and it layers them the same way by
# reading the shipped file before the override, so the LAST assignment to an
# alias wins and an override row REPLACES the shipped row for that alias while
# adding rows the shipped table does not carry. One map, emitted in the order
# the aliases were first seen, so the output is stable.

#
# SWAP AND RESTART, THE READ SIDE.
#
#   A SWAP is a planned stop — a usage reset, a profile switch — and a RESTART
#   is the launch that follows it. Neither adds a file. The RECORD a swap
#   leaves is the lane's own PAUSED line, payload
#   `swap; window <tmux session>:<index>; workstation <ws>`, and a lane is
#   SWAPPED on a workstation when that PAUSED is its LAST lane-kind line.
#
#   Both reads here are READ-ONLY and neither ever writes. `swapped` is what a
#   launcher asks when the tmux window name is gone — a restart opens a NEW
#   tmux session, which is precisely why the window name cannot carry the lane
#   across one. `session-start` is the SessionStart hook's whole output.

# The register's own spelling of a lane whose name matches $1 ignoring case,
# read from `origin/<branch>` like every other state read (R19). Rule 10's wire
# form is lowercase and a tmux window may carry either, while the row's token is
# camel (`openRepoProject-1`): an exact lookup alone loses the lane.

# AMENDMENT 11 — THE RECORD'S SUB-FIELDS, AND THE READS BUILT ON THEM
# ============================================================================
#
# Amendment 11 clause (c) gives the lane's `STARTED`/`RESUMED` lines and the
# swap record two new payload sub-fields, `dir <path>` and `profile <name>`,
# beside Amendment 8(b)'s `window`, which gains a second ref. Clause (h) turns
# the reads of them into subcommands, for the reason Amendment 7(d) already
# gives `live-holder` and `lane-objects`: EACH READ EXISTS SO THAT SEVERAL
# CALLERS SHARE ONE IMPLEMENTATION. `window-lane` has three (the launcher's
# precedence 3, `/restart`'s step 2(c), the `/lane-swap` skill's step 1);
# `session-lane` has two (`/restart`'s step 2(b) and the SessionStart hook);
# `lane-dir` has four. A rule implemented once cannot be implemented three
# ways, which is exactly how the launcher, the skill and `/restart` would come
# to disagree about which lane a window is.

# ONE PARSER OF A PAYLOAD'S SUB-FIELDS, AND ONE UNQUOTER.
#
# Amendment 7(b)'s grammar: sub-fields are separated by `; `, and SEVERAL REFS
# INSIDE ONE SUB-FIELD ARE SEPARATED BY SPACES — which is what the `window`
# sub-field's `<session>:<index> <@id>` relies on. So an unquoted
# `dir $HOME/my projects/x` (unquoted) parses as two refs and hands back a truncated
# path, and clause (c)'s rule is that the WRITER QUOTES a value containing a
# space and EVERY READER takes a value opening with `"` as running to its
# closing `"`, stripping both.
#
# Two modes, because the grammar has two kinds of value:
#   (default)  ONE REF — the value up to its first space, or the whole of a
#              quoted value. `dir` and `profile` are read this way.
#   all        EVERY REF — the whole sub-field, which is what `window` is:
#              two refs that a caller splits itself.

# ---------------------------------------- AMENDMENT 17(b): THE TWO SUB-FIELDS
#
# `agent <name>` and `transcript <id|none>`, VALIDATED BY THE WRITER. Amendment
# 17(b) gives the `PAUSED` payload both; nothing else in this file could check
# them, because a payload is free text to `write_event` — and this log is
# APPEND-ONLY, so a sub-field written wrong is wrong for ever and no later line
# corrects it. The check is the same shape `valid_uuid` gives the session field
# under clause (e): the WRITER is the gate, from any caller.
#
# WHAT EACH ADMITS, and why the pattern is the rule rather than a list:
#   agent       A MANIFEST KEY — letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`. It is what
#               `lane-start --agent <name>` reads back to choose a launcher, so
#               a value carrying a space or a `;` is a value that would come
#               back as two sub-fields or as an argument nobody meant. The
#               pattern is also how this sub-field gets SPEC rev 6 §5's `; `
#               rule without a token of its own — the same argument clause (c)'s
#               `profile` takes.
#   transcript  THE AGENT'S OWN RESUMABLE ID, or the literal `none` — which is
#               an ANSWER ("this agent has no resumable id") and not a gap.
#               Claude's is a uuid; another agent's is whatever that agent
#               prints, so the shape is the same manifest key rather than
#               `valid_uuid`, which would refuse every agent but one.
#
# A PAYLOAD CARRYING NEITHER IS VALID AND STAYS VALID. Every record written
# before this amendment carries neither, and Amendment 7(i)'s cutover rule is
# that a reader finding none says so rather than assuming one. The check fires
# only on a sub-field that is THERE.
# THE TWO ARE WRITTEN TOGETHER OR NOT AT ALL, AND AN EMPTY ONE IS NOT AN
# ABSENT ONE (Copilot rounds 1 and 2 on openRepoTools#47). The first shape of
# this gate entered on either sub-field and then accepted each empty result
# independently, which let a HALF record through: `agent codex` with no
# transcript, or `transcript <id>` with no agent, both of which `lane-start`
# reads one field of and defaults the other — launching Claude on a codex id,
# or codex on none. And a sub-field written EMPTY (`; agent ; …`) parsed
# identically to one that was never there, so a malformed line was indexed as a
# pre-amendment one for ever, in a log nothing rewrites.
#
# PRESENCE IS READ OFF THE SUB-FIELDS, never off the whole line: `dir
# /srv/agent-work` carries the letters and is not the field.

# THE LAST LINE CARRYING ONE, NOT THE LAST LINE. A lane started under Amendment
# 11 and then PAUSED for a reason that is not a swap has a last line with no

#   * the LAST lane-kind line that carries a sub-field wins, in FILE ORDER;
#   * a value opening with `"` runs to its closing `"`, quotes stripped, and any

#   * `/restart`'s step 2(c) (clause (f)),
#   * the `/lane-swap` skill's step 1 (Amendment 8(a) step 1, extended).
#
# TWO RUNGS, first answer wins:
#   1. the window's own NAME, where the register has a row for it. That is
#      clause (b)'s precedence 2 read through the same door, so a caller that
#      asks this read a ref gets the same answer the launcher would.
#   2. this workstation's swap records, matched on the ref.
#
# SCOPED TO THE ASKING WORKSTATION, IN THE CONTRACT AND NOT ONLY IN `Open`. A
# `<session>:<index>` is a local fact about one machine, and `claude-x:0`
# written on Raven collides with `claude-y:0` on Eagle far more easily than an
# `<@id>` will. `swapped` takes `[<ws>]` for exactly that reason and this read
# takes it for the same one: records written by another workstation are NOT
# CONSIDERED.
#
# THE AGREEMENT RULE, AND THIS READ OWNS IT. Existing-now is not enough on its
# own: a record naming `claude-y:0 @97`, met from the window that has since
# taken `claude-y:0` as `@200`, passes the existing-now test on its ref and
# would bind the lane to a stranger's pane with no question — which is the
# failure the liveness fence exists to stop, arriving through the LIVE ref
# instead of the dead one. So:
#
#   a record that carries an `<@id>` is matched on its `<session>:<index>` ONLY
#   WHERE THE WINDOW NOW HOLDING THAT REF REPORTS THAT SAME ID; a record with
#   no id is matched on the ref alone.

# ------------------------- decision 8(c) and 8(e): A FORK IS NEVER A HOLDER
#
# Evidence 6, 2026-09-13: an abandoned launch of a lane left behind a DAEMON
# FORK of its transcript — `--fork-session`, a NEW session id, `kind: bg`, no
# tmux, a cwd of `/workspace` — which went on orchestrating the same plan,
# relaunched writers on the same three branches, wrote `RESUMED` and `PAUSED`
# lines into the lane's log, and messaged the interactive session claiming to
# be the holder while citing a dead pid.
#
# Amendment 8 ruling (g) already skips a `kind: bg` companion, and that is not
# enough: a fork is a SESSION OF ITS OWN with an id no row carries, so the
# thing that makes it recognisable is neither its kind nor its id but ITS
# TRANSCRIPT'S TITLE. A `--fork-session` copies the parent's `custom-title`
# record, so the fork's transcript says `openRepoProject-1` while its id says
# something the lane's row has never heard of. That pair — THE LANE'S TITLE
# UNDER AN ID THE LANE DOES NOT RECORD — is the defect, and it is what this
# read finds.
#
# IT NAMES THEM AND DOES NOTHING ELSE, exactly as `idle_holders` does and for
# the same reason clause (f) of Amendment 8 gives. THE ACT IT NAMES IS
# `lane-end <lane> --retire <pid|uuid>` (clause (k) rule (e), A11 Addendum 4
# ruling 8) and never `kill <pid>`: that act is the DOOR to Amendment 6(d), it
# writes nothing and *"neither kills a process"*. So this read goes on naming a
# fork until 6(d) is actually taken on it — the retitle, or the process gone —
# which is what is TRUE; and stopping the process stays a person's act that no
# surface here prints as the one.
#
# One line per fork, `<session id><TAB><pid><TAB><kind><TAB><cwd>`.
# 0 with rows, 8 with none, 1 where the records could not be read.
# Every LIVE record on this workstation whose transcript carries a custom
# title, as
# `<lc title><US><title><US><sessionId><US><lc sessionId><US><pid><US><kind><US><cwd>`.
# Built ONCE per process: `who` asks about every lane in the register, and one
# find per record per lane would be a read nobody would run.
#
# CACHED IN A FILE for the reason `live_session_ids` gives, and this one was the
# more expensive of the two: `transcript_title` falls back to a `find` over the
# whole profiles tree, so a rebuild per lane was a filesystem walk per lane.
#
# THE LOWER-CASED TITLE AND ID ARE CARRIED rather than computed by the reader:

# ------------------------------- decisions 6 and 7: THE LANE LISTING READ
#
# ONE READ, TWO LISTINGS. Decision 6 ratified the estate-wide `lanes`; decision
# 7 ratified `restart`'s per-repo listing and `/restart`'s. All three are the
# same rows with a different filter, so the filter is an argument here rather
# than three implementations in three commands — the rule clause (h) already
# gives `window-lane` and `session-lane`.
#
# READ-ONLY, out of `origin/<branch>` like every Amendment 7 read, and
# `LANES_NO_FETCH=1` is honoured by the one `log_sync` its caller makes. It
# never writes and never launches anything.
#
#   lanes_rows [--repo <owner/repo>] [--dir <path>] [--ws <ws>] [--all]
#
# `--repo` and `--dir` are decision 7's per-repo scope and they are an OR, not
# an AND: "rows whose register `home` is this checkout's `origin`, OR whose
# recorded `dir` is this checkout". That second half is a second use for clause
# (c)'s `dir` and an argument for recording it, because a lane's home
# repository and the checkout it sits in are not the same fact.
#
# Tab-separated, one line per lane, and the COLUMNS ARE THE DATA rather than a
# rendering: `restart` and `lanes` lay them out, and a third caller that wants
# a different shape does not need a fourth read.
#
#   <lane> <state> <workstation> <profile> <window> <last uuid> <dir>
#   <objects> <age> <restart line> <home> <forks>
#
# THE FIRST TEN ARE CLAUSE (j)'s TEN, IN CLAUSE (j)'s ORDER (A11 Addendum 4
# ruling 7): *"`lanes` and `restart` each render the subset of clause (j)'s ten
# columns their surface needs while the read carries all ten."* Column 10 — the
# restart line — used to be computed by each renderer, which is two
# implementations of one column; it is the read's now, so the two surfaces
# cannot disagree about which lane may be restarted or about what to type.
#
# `<home>` and `<forks>` are the read's own additions after the ten.
# `<forks>` is decision 8(e): the count of LIVE forks of this lane's transcript
# — a defect to retire, shown by both listings and never counted as a holder.
#
# Newest activity first, by the UTC of the lane's last lane-kind line. That is
# a clock and it decides nothing but the ORDER OF A LISTING, which is the one
# place a clock is allowed to: `swapped` ranks by landing order because a
# launcher BINDS from its first row, and nothing binds from this one.

# every record to do it, which for a 48-row register is 48 scans of the same
# directory.
#
# CACHED IN A FILE AND NOT IN A VARIABLE (A11 Addendum 4 ruling 12). Every
# caller invokes this inside `$( … )`, which is a SUBSHELL — so the variable the

#

#             written. It used to be this workstation's, and that was never in
#             the contract: `window-lane` is scoped and the contract says so at
#             length (`R-A11-8`/RV-T7); this read is not. "List the lanes" on a
#             two-workstation estate means both.
#   --here    this workstation only. The old default, kept as an OPTION.
#   --ws <n>  a named workstation only, which implies the same narrowing.
#   --all     no narrowing of any kind: it CLEARS `--repo`, `--dir`, `--prefix`
#             and `--here`, so a caller that has narrowed can undo it in one
#             word. That is what the settlement means by "`--all` forces the
#             every-lane listing".
#
# `--prefix <repo>` is the LABEL fallback and nothing more: a lane whose log
# records NEITHER a home NOR a directory cannot be filed by either, and its
# name's `<repo>-` prefix is the only thing left. Amendment 7 calls that prefix
# a label rather than a fact, so it is used ONLY where the two facts are absent
# — never to override a home that disagrees with it, which is the case

# --------------------- AMENDMENT 18 ADDENDUM 1: THE PICK'S TWO READS ---------
#
# `lane` (Addendum 1 (i-1), ratified 2026-09-14T14:05:54Z verbatim "ratify the
# addendum") renders THE SAME ROWS `lanes` renders — in three groups, with a
# number in front of each. Neither the grouping nor the next free position is
# that word's own: both are computed HERE, over the rows `lanes_rows` printed,
# because two surfaces computing one answer is how they come to disagree. That
# is the rule clause (h) already gives `window-lane` and `session-lane`, and the
# one A11 Addendum 4 ruling 7 gave column 10 after `lanes` and `restart` had
# each computed a restart line of its own.
#
# ROWS ON STDIN, like `sibling-filter` one screen down: the caller has already
# made the read and paid for it, and a subcommand that read the register a
# second time would double the cost of every pick to answer a question about
# the rows already in its hand. Neither of these two reads the register, the
# logs, the session records or the network at all.

# THE PARTITION, AND IT IS THE STATE COLUMN'S (clause (i-2)):
#
#   available   PARKED — a lane nobody holds — or A BINDING THIS HOST PROVES
#               DEAD: a lane whose last verb was STARTED or RESUMED, on this
#               workstation, with no live session record naming any of its ids.
#               `lanes_rows` has already made that proof, and it is the whole
#               difference between its `LIVE` and its `IDLE`.
#   live        LIVE: a live session record on this workstation names one of the
#               row's ids. The act is the ATTACH and never a second process.
#   elsewhere   a binding this host CANNOT prove dead, because the row is
#               another workstation's: the session records are local files, so
#               saying NOT LIVE about Raven from Eagle would be a claim this
#               machine has no way to make. Clause (c)'s handoff question.
#
# CLOSED AND DORMANT LANES LEAVE THE PICK (Amendment 19). A lane whose last act
# was its last is not a lane a person picks, and a pick that offered one would
# be offering to reopen something closed on purpose. `ENDED` and `RETIRED` are
# that set in today's vocabulary and `CLOSED`/`DORMANT` are the words the rows
# take under #42; both are named here, so the pick is right under either and
# the word does not have to move when the read does. They are still ROWS in
# `lanes`, which is the READ — this is a pick.

# THE NEXT FREE POSITION, over those same rows: clause (i-1)'s `f` answer, and
# the footer `lanes` has printed since Brett Heap's settlement of
# 2026-09-13T20:38:11Z. It is the LOWEST one NO ROW HOLDS and never the highest
# plus one, because handing out 12 while 3 has never been used grows a column
# nobody reads — and `lane-start` refuses a position that is taken, so this is a
# suggestion with a guard behind it and never an assertion.
#
# A POSITION A LANE HAS HELD IS RESERVED, ENDED AND RETIRED ROWS INCLUDED
# (Copilot round 7 on #45, `lanes-edit.sh:4839`, where this paragraph said
# positions "come back as lanes end" and the code has never done that). EVERY
# row on stdin is taken, whatever its state, and that is deliberate: a lane's
# identity is its name, its object log is `lanes/log/<lane>.md` and it is
# APPEND-ONLY, so a second lane at a retired position would write its life into
# the first one's file and every read of that log — who holds what, when it was
# claimed, which session paused it — would answer for two lanes at once. The
# register's row is the same story in one line. Positions are cheap; identities
# are not.
#
# A POSITION IS DIGITS WITH AN OPTIONAL TRAILING LETTER, which is
# `lane-start`'s own rule: `5a` and `5` are one position taken twice, because a
# lane may be re-cut and a re-cut position is not free, and it is the only
# reading under which `openxfactory-4-opendox-extraction` has no position at
# all. The comparison is case-insensitive on both sides, like every other lookup
# of a lane name in this file (Amendment 15).

#
# THE LAST TWO ARE AMENDMENT 17(b)'s, and they are added at the END for the
# reason the fourth and fifth were: the FIRST FIELD BEFORE THE FIRST TAB is the
# contract every reader of this output takes (the launcher, the `handoff`
# skill's step 1, `lane-start`'s directory rung 2 and `restart`'s, each with the
# same comment saying so), and each of the others is read by its own index. A
# record written before an amendment carries its fields EMPTY rather than
# guessed — Amendment 7(i)'s cutover rule, which is what makes a sixth and a
# seventh safe to add at all.
#
# WHICH LINE IS A LANE'S "LAST" IS FILE ORDER (R14), like every other state read
# here: a lane's log is append-only and single-writer, so a line further down
# the file is a line written later whatever the two UTC fields say — and this is
# the read a restart resolves its lane from, so letting a clock decide it would
# be the same fault Amendment 7 removed everywhere else.
#
# THE ROWS ARE ORDERED BY LANDING ORDER ON `origin/<branch>`, MOST RECENTLY
# LANDED FIRST — the position of the commit that ADDED each lane's PAUSED line,
# and never the UTC in it. File order does not reach across two lanes' files,
# and two lanes' UTCs are two clocks: they may be two workstations' (Amendment 7
# gives them no shared order at all) or one workstation's mid-jump — this one
# was observed stepping ±25 s in bursts, and a log commit landed whose content
# carried a UTC 26 s after its own committer date. Git's push serialization is
# the one order both lanes really share, and it is the same arbiter clause (f)
# already uses to decide a race. The UTC stays in the output as INFORMATION, and
# decides nothing.
#
# The rank is the DAG distance from the tip (`rev-list --count <sha>..origin`),
# not a committer date, so it is history order and not a clock either. Swapped
# lanes are few — one per window a swap paused — so one pickaxe per candidate is
# the cheap read. A candidate whose adding commit cannot be found (no remote ref
# here, or the harness's LANES_NO_GIT=1) ranks last, and those fall back to UTC
# order among themselves: an order that is merely unhelpful, never wrong.

# ============================================================================
# AMENDMENT 12 — THE NAME GUARD AND THE LOCK, WITH AMENDMENT 18(h)'S ONE READ
# ============================================================================
#
# **A LANE SESSION WORKS ONLY WHILE THREE NAMES ARE ONE** — the tmux WINDOW it
# runs in, the SESSION's own name, and the register ROW whose session cell ends
# on this transcript — **and otherwise the prompt is REFUSED** (exit 2), with
# the triple as it stands and the ONE command that cures it, filled in. Ratified
# 2026-09-13T18:20:44Z, "Ratify revision 2", with M1 "Type /rename into the
# pane"; `brettheap/new-workstation#22`/#23, opensoft/openRepoTools#25.
#
# WHY THE RULE NEEDED AN ENFORCEMENT. Amendment 2 has said since 2026-09-05 that
# a lane is its window's name and its session's name; nothing refused anything
# for eight days, and between 2026-09-10 and 2026-09-12 this very lane ran as
# `openRepoTools-3`, `-4`, … `-14` — a fresh title per `/resume`, in a window
# still named `claude`, in profiles that changed at every usage reset — and no
# row was ever written. `session_start_block` above says which lane a window is
# and "ALWAYS exits 0"; `window_session` "decides nothing". This is the surface
# that decides.
#
# THE LOCK (clause (h), Brett Heap's D5). Under the projects root the session
# name is not the person's to set freely; it is the lane's. The tooling sets it
# at every launch (`lane-start --name "$LANE"`, clause (c)) and again whenever it
# drifts — by TYPING `/rename <lane>` into the session's own tmux pane, which is
# the only mechanism a running session has (M1, "Type /rename into the pane"):
# the docs name `--name` at launch, `/rename`, and `Ctrl+R` in the picker, and
# nothing else — no hook output field, no environment variable, no settings key.
# A PERSON'S rename to another lane's name is not drift but an INSTRUCTION, and
# it is OFFERED back before it is obeyed: yes moves this window to that lane, no
# renames the session back.
#
# FAIL CLOSED (clause (d)). A mismatch refuses; so does an INDETERMINATE read —
# session records unreadable, tmux not answering, the register unreadable —
# naming the read, because a triple that cannot be verified is not a triple that
# agrees. There is no environment flag that turns this off: `claude --safe-mode`
# disables every hook and is the one bypass, deliberate and visible in the
# prompt box, and a session started that way is not a lane session and may not
# write the register or claim an object.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, AND THE ONE WAY IT FAILS OPEN. Measured on Eagle 2026-09-14
# against 329 session records and a 1.3 MB register: the register read is ~2 s
# wall and the `grep -l` over every profile's records ~0.4 s, so a refusal lands
# inside the ratified `timeout 5`. A hook that EXCEEDS its timeout is killed, and
# a killed hook does not exit 2 — so the timeout is the one path on which this
# guard fails open. It is the amendment's own number and is left at it; the
# cheap tests are made first so that the two reads happen only where they decide
# something.
#
# IT NEVER FETCHES. `session-start`'s R-A8-1 argument applies here several times
# over — that hook runs once per session and this one runs at EVERY PROMPT — so
# the row is read from `origin/<branch>` AS THIS CHECKOUT LAST HAD IT (R19, the
# same `register_text` every other state read takes) and the network is never
# opened. "The register not fetchable" (clause (d)) is therefore the READ
# failing, and that refuses.

# A LANE NAME IS `<repo>-<position>` (THE LANE RULE), and this is the predicate
# for it: `check_lane_name`'s character fence, plus a LAST `-` followed by
# digits. It agrees with `lane_start_args` by construction — that function
# prints `--dir <path> <lane>` for exactly the names this refuses — and the two
# exist separately because one answers a question and the other builds a command
# line. A name the register has a row for is a lane whatever its shape
# (`browser-ui-repair` is one); this asks only whether the two arguments of
# `lane-start` can be read OUT of a name nobody has a row for yet, which is what
# rows 1 and 6 of the table below need.

# ------------------------------------- AMENDMENT 18(h): ONE LIVE PROCESS
#
# *"A transcript (one session id) is held by ONE live process. The harness can
# fork one (`--fork-session`, minting a new id in a background pty host) or
# resume one twice, and the tooling refuses to build on either."* Ratified
# 2026-09-14T13:15:18Z as revision 4 of Amendment 18;
# `brettheap/new-workstation#34`, opensoft/openRepoTools#39.
#
# MEASURED FOUR TIMES ON 2026-09-14, the fourth at 18:14Z: a `bg` record in ONE
# profile's `sessions/` and an interactive record in ANOTHER's, both live, both
# carrying one `sessionId` — which is why this sweeps EVERY profile's directory
# and not the asking session's. On a launcher-configured workstation every
# profile's `projects/` is one shared directory, so a transcript needs no move
# to be resumed under another profile and a duplicate is one `--resume` away.
#
# THREE CALLERS, ONE IMPLEMENTATION, for the reason clause (h) already gives
# `window-lane`: `lane-start` refuses to bind or resume an id another process
# holds, `lane-end --retire <pid>` retires that process, and the prompt guard
# refuses every prompt inside it. A rule implemented three times is a rule three
# surfaces come to disagree about.
#
# IT IS BUILT ON A `grep -l`, NOT ON `session_records`. This runs at every prompt
# under a five-second timeout, and the one-pass parse is a per-process CACHE that
# the first caller pays for in full — 329 records here. The question asked is
# about ONE id the harness has already handed the hook, so the cheap shape is the
# one `live_holder` uses: one grep for the id, then a parse of the one or two
# files that match. Measured at ~0.4 s against those 329.
#
#   <pid><US><kind><US><tmux|none><US><profile><US><where><US><verdict><US><file>
#
# `where` is for a person to read — `window <session>:<@id>`, the same with
# ` (gone)` where the agreement rule above refuses it, or `bg`.
#
# THE VERDICT IS THE WHOLE OF THE JUDGEMENT, and it has four values because
# THREE IN-FORCE RULES MEET HERE AND NONE OF THEM MAY BE OVERTURNED BY THIS ONE:
#
#   here        the record is THIS window's own process — its `tmux` names this
#               window, or its pid is this pane's or below it: `record_is_here`'s
#               TIERS 2 AND 3, and its tier 1 is left out because it cannot
#               discriminate here. That tier asks whether the record's
#               `sessionId` is `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, and every candidate in
#               this set carries the very id being tested — so on the asking
#               session's own transcript it would answer `here` for the
#               duplicate too, which is the one reading this function exists to
#               prevent.
#   companion   not this window's, in the SAME profile's `sessions/` as this
#               window's own record of this id, AND NOT A SESSION RECORD.
#               AMENDMENT 8, RULING (g) names exactly one such thing: *"Beside
#               the interactive process in the pane the harness runs a companion:
#               `kind: bg`, no `tmux`, no `nameSource`, its own pid, and THE SAME
#               `sessionId` … Records that share a `sessionId` are one session,
#               not a queue of rival holders, and there is no contest between
#               them to win."* The harness writes a session's own records under
#               that session's own `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so same-profile is what
#               "the harness's own second record of one session" looks like —
#               and the `kind` is what tells that record apart from a SECOND
#               INTERACTIVE PROCESS in the same directory, which is one
#               transcript resumed twice and is 18(h)'s own case rather than the
#               harness's companion. The profile alone read a second `--resume`
#               UNDER ONE PROFILE as benign (Copilot round 1 on this PR), and
#               that is the cheapest way there is to make two live processes on
#               one transcript: no move, no swap, one command.
#               THE KIND IS `bg` AND NOTHING ELSE IS READ AS ONE. `not a session
#               record` was the first spelling of this test and it was too wide
#               by exactly the kinds nobody has ruled on: this suite's own
#               interactive fork carries `kind: user`
#               (`tests/test_lane_helpers.sh`, Amendment 11 clause (k)), and any
#               kind a later harness invents would have arrived here as the
#               harness's benign companion (Copilot round 2 on this PR). Ruling
#               (g) names ONE shape to pass over, so that shape is what this
#               matches; every other live record on this id — known kind or not,
#               and a record too old to carry a `kind` at all, which pass 1
#               writes down as `interactive` — is a duplicate, which is the
#               closed direction.
#   duplicate   EVERY OTHER live record carrying this id: a session record in
#               another window of this same profile, or any record at all in
#               ANOTHER profile's `sessions/` beside this window's own. That is
#               AMENDMENT 18(h)'s second live process. The MEASURED shape was the
#               second one — four times on 2026-09-14, the last at 18:14Z, the
#               second record sat in another profile's directory, and 18(h) says
#               why, *"on a launcher-configured workstation every profile's
#               `projects/` is one shared directory … which is also why a
#               duplicate is one `--resume` away"* — but the rule it states is
#               one live PROCESS per transcript, not one per profile.
#   unrelated   THIS WINDOW CARRIES NO RECORD OF THIS TRANSCRIPT AT ALL, so this
#               read says nothing about the processes that do. That is not
#               timidity: `live_holder` answers "is any session this row names
#               alive" and Amendment 8(f) rules an ORPHAN reported and never
#               refused, while `lane_forks` answers about a fork. A rule that
#               counted every live record here would overturn both from a read
#               that was not asked about either. ONE CALLER TAKES IT AS A
#               BLOCKER ANYWAY AND SAYS SO WHERE IT DOES: `lane-start`'s
#               `dup_check`, asked about the ONE id a run is about to resume,
#               where an `unrelated` holder is a second live process on the very
#               file that run is about to open (Amendment 18(h), *"never
#               launches a second resume of it"*). That is a narrower question
#               than this verdict answers, so the narrowing lives at that call
#               site and not in this table.

# the reasoning that the harness is a node program and this format reports the
# process rather than the wrapper; MEASURED on Eagle 2026-09-14T23:4xZ, across
# the twelve panes tmux had, it is not: eleven lane panes report `claude`, two
# report `bash` (a pane whose session is under a launcher wrapper) and one
# `zsh`, and no pane reports `node` at all. So `node` bought nothing here and
# would have let a stray Node REPL in a pane take `/rename <lane>` as input

# ------------- THE UUID INTO THE NEW LANE'S CELL, WHICH `lane-start` MAY NOT DO
#
# CLAUSE (h) RULE 2 NAMES THE END STATE AND RULE 3 REPEATS IT: after a `yes`,
# *"window X, session X, ROW X STAMPED WITH THIS UUID"*. `lane-start --no-launch`
# performs every other part of that and CANNOT perform this one, by a fence that
# is right and stays: its step 3b VETO 1 — Amendment 11 clause (d) rule 1 —
# never takes a uuid that belongs to ANOTHER ROW, and after a rename this uuid
# belongs to `$ga_from`'s. So it mints a fresh id for the new lane instead and
# the person's own transcript is left out of the cell the next resume follows.
#
# MEASURED, AND IT IS A LOOP AND NOT A BLEMISH. In the suite: `yes` moved the
# window to `repoGD-2`, whose row then read `STARTED by 7a01ae69…` while this
# session was `aaaa0012-1111…`. The NEXT prompt therefore finds a lane window
# whose row does not name this transcript — the last row of the (b) table — and
# refuses with `lane-start --no-launch repoGD 2`, which vetoes for the same
# reason and changes nothing. A blocking hook that refuses for ever, on a state
# it created by obeying the person, is the worst outcome this surface has.
#
# SO THE GUARD MAKES THE LAST WRITE ITSELF, and only after the person's `yes`.
# That is not a hole in veto 1: the veto exists for the take nobody asked for —
# *"`lane-start openXfactory-5` typed from a window named `openRepoProject-1`"*,
# Evidence 2(b) — and clause (h) rule 4's own limit is that the lock *"never
# moves a uuid between rows WITHOUT the person's `yes`"*. Here there is one, on
# the record, answered at this very prompt.
#
# THE ANCHOR DISCIPLINE IS `lane-start`'s, unvaried: the anchor is the PUBLISHED
# last id, so a checkout whose copy of the row is older than the one that landed
# REFUSES rather than writing a cell that no longer matches; a row whose cell
# records no uuid at all is anchored on `none recorded`, the one other text a
# cell this act can meet carries, and anything else prints the act and guesses

# ----------------------------------------------------------------- GitHub
#
# Rule 1 is one act: the three reads, the local line, and the comment that
# another person reads. The LOG is authoritative for a claim made through
# `claim` — a log line IS a live claim for Rule 1 purposes — and the GitHub
# comment is the copy that a person outside this estate can see.
# --no-github skips every call here, which is what the tests and an offline
# lane run with.

# THE SIBLING READS NAME THE OBJECT, NOT ITS DIGITS (Amendment 8). Rule 1's
# reads 2 and 3 searched for the bare slug as a SUBSTRING, and a number is a
# substring of almost everything. Measured live on 2026-09-12 against the
# governing repository, `gh pr list --search 15` answered with PR #16 and PR
# #10 — GitHub had matched the digits inside "**15 of the register's 41 rows**"
# — and `ls-remote | grep 15` answered with a branch whose 40-character sha
# merely contains them, all under the heading "existing work on this object".
# A sibling that does not NAME the object is not evidence about it, and evidence
# that is not evidence is how a lane talks itself out of a claim it should make.
#
# TWO READS, TWO TESTS, because the two inputs are not the same kind of text.
#   pr      `gh pr list`'s rows, which are prose. A number in prose is a
#           number; a REFERENCE is `#<n>`, so the hash is required — and its
#           LEFT side is not bounded, because the canonical spelling of the
#           thing being looked for is `owner/repo#15` and the character before
#           the `#` is a letter. A row whose FIRST field is the number itself
#           is kept too: that is the PR the object IS.
#   branch  `ls-remote`'s refs, which are names. `issue-15-fix` names the
#           object and carries no hash, so the bare number as a whole token is
#           the test — after the leading sha is stripped, so a branch is matched
#           by its name and never by the digits of the commit it points at.
# An OpenSpec change directory has a word for a slug and takes the whole-token
# test in both modes.
#
# AND READ 2 FILTERS OVER THE BODY. `gh pr list`'s columns are number, title,
# branch and state; the reference that makes a PR a sibling is almost always in
# its BODY, which is what GitHub's own search matched and what the columns do
# not carry. Filtering the columns alone dropped PR #16 — the PR for this very
# issue, whose body says `brettheap/new-workstation#15` twice — while a filter
# with the hash optional kept #10 instead. So the body is fetched, flattened to
# one line, used for the test, and cut off again before anything is printed:
# under-reporting a sibling is the direction that lets a lane claim what
# somebody is already working on, and it is the one direction Rule 1 cannot

  # AMENDMENT 8, R-A8-4 — THE UUID APPEND IS CELL-SCOPED.
  #
  # `replace-in-row` refuses unless its anchor occurs exactly once in the WHOLE
  # ROW, and the anchor for a session-cell append is a transcript uuid — which
  # the 6(c) stamp writes into the STATE cell again on every launch (`RESUMED by
  # <uuid> … launching claude --resume <uuid>` — twice more per launched start).
  # Measured against `origin/main` on 2026-09-12, `openRepoProject-1`'s own row
  # carries its current uuid THREE times and its previous one three times, so
  # the single most load-bearing new act in Amendment 8(d) — recording the
  # transcript the harness minted — could not run on the lane the amendment was
  # written for.
  #
  # So the anchor is matched INSIDE THE SESSION CELL and nowhere else, and must
  # occur exactly once THERE. `replace-in-row`'s whole-row rule is unchanged and
  # is still right for what it is for: a state cell says the same thing in two
  # places all the time, and a blind replace there would rewrite the wrong one.
  #
  # AND THE TEXT IS APPENDED AT THE END OF THE CELL, NOT AT THE ANCHOR. This is
  # the second half of the same finding and it is not cosmetic: the cell spells
  # its ids `harness `<uuid>`` — inside backticks — so a replace AT a bare-uuid
  # anchor writes `harness `<uuid> → harness <new>`` and puts the new id inside
  # the old one's code span. The anchor's job is to prove that the cell this
  # checkout holds is the published one the caller read (Amendment 6(b): the
  # cell is a HISTORY, oldest first, and the last id is the lane's current
  # session); the APPEND's job is to add a lineage after all of them. Those are
  # two different positions, and conflating them corrupted the cell.
  #
  # Anything that is not an append — a cell that must really be rewritten — is
  # `replace-in-row`'s business, in front of a person.

  # ------------------------------ AMENDMENT 11, clause (h): the new reads
  #
  # ALL READ-ONLY; all answer out of `origin/<branch>` as every Amendment 7
  # read does; all honour `LANES_NO_FETCH=1`, because each one sits in front of
  # a launch and a launcher must not sit on the network to open a terminal; and
  # all follow Amendment 7(d)'s fail-closed convention — 0 an answer, 8 NO
  # ANSWER, 64 a usage error of their own, and anything else a failed read that
  # a caller must not read as "nothing to report".
  #
  # WITH ONE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS THE ONE EVERY UN-UPGRADED WORKSTATION IS IN:
  # a `lanes-edit.sh` that has never heard of one of these exits **2** for an
  # unknown subcommand, exactly as a pre-Amendment-8 one did for `swapped`.
  # That is A HELPER PREDATING THE AMENDMENT THAT ADDED THE READ — expected and
  # silent — and a caller falls to its next rung there rather than refusing.
  # The two kinds of 2 are told apart by the helper's own WORDS and not by its
  # status: the `*)` arm below says "unknown subcommand" and no other refusal
  # here does.

  # ADOPTION ACT 0 SHIPS `session-lane`, AND IT IS BELOW RATHER THAN HERE.
  # `opensoft/brett-wip#5` @`3719d97` added it and `openRepoTools#24` — MERGED as
# `d4b5710` on this repository's `main`, which is the sha act 3 is cited by from
# here on rather than a branch name — ported that
  # commit into this copy, so this branch carries NO second implementation of it
  # (A11 Addendum 3, CF-T11: act 0 ships FOUR items, and that is the fourth).
  # `3719d97` IS THE MERGE COMMIT. Act 0 merged 2026-09-13T19:14:37Z, squashed,
  # so the draft head `95e7a4c` this comment used to cite is not an ancestor of
  # `origin/main` at all (F-X18, A11 Addendum 4 ruling 13).
  # `/restart`'s step 2(b) and `lane-start`'s step 3b both call the ported arm.

  # The lane bound to a window OF THE ASKING WORKSTATION. Three callers share
  # this one implementation — the launcher's precedence 3, `/restart`'s step
  # 2(c), and the `/lane-swap` skill's step 1 — and it owns the `<@id>`-versus-
  # ref agreement rule for all three (A11 Addendum 2, `R-A11-8`).
  #

  # two callers rather than a second implementation of the same question.
  #

  # <id>`), and one of those is not that session's lane.

  # every other read in clause (h); adoption act 0 item (4), which says 2, is
  # the line corrected."*

  # every workstation answers until act 3's install reaches it. A caller that
  # cannot tell that 2 from a usage 2 cannot tell *"install the helper"* from
