# lanes-edit.sh — the sanctioned writer for the estate lane registry (LANES.md).
#
# Protocol: ~/.agents/protocols/lane-collision-protocol.md, Rule 9 (registry in
# git) and Rule 10 (workstation designation), Amendment 3, 2026-09-09 — moved
# to the person's workspace repository by Amendment 5, 2026-09-10.
#
# WHERE THE REGISTER LIVES (Amendment 5, 2026-09-10; Amendment 9(a), 2026-09-13)
#   `lanes/LANES.md` on `main` of THE PERSON'S OWN workspace repository — the
#   `<org>/<login>-wip` that `$AGENT_PROTOCOL_ROOT/workspace.yaml` names, which
#   is `opensoft/brett-wip` for the person this file was written for and
#   `opensoft/scott-wip` for the next one. This file names no repository of its
#   own: Amendment 5's second-person clause put a second person's register in a
#   second repository, and Amendment 9 is what made that reachable. Direct commits to
#   `main` are the norm THERE by design: the repository is excluded from the
#   organisation's PR-only ruleset precisely so that a per-edit registry
#   commit can land, which is what Rule 9 requires and what the orphan
#   `lanes` branch of `opensoft/xFactory` used to be for. That branch is
#   RETIRED, and its history came across whole with this file.
#
#   Every path a lane already uses keeps resolving:
#   `~/projects/xFactory/LANES.md` and `~/projects/xFactory/lanes-edit.sh`
#   are symlinks into the checkout, placed by `link-estates`.
#   This script never spells the checkout's own path, and since Amendment 9(a)
#   it no longer derives it from its own location either: it reads
#   `repository:` and `path:` from `$AGENT_PROTOCOL_ROOT/workspace.yaml`, the
#   same pointer file `resume` and `status` already read. This file is an
#   installed command in `~/.local/bin` with no register anywhere near it, so
#   its own directory is evidence about the command and not about a person's
#   data. Failing to find the workspace is a refusal naming
#   `openRepoTools wip init`, never a guess.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   LANES.md is edited by many concurrent lanes on more than one workstation.
#   On 2026-09-08T23:46Z a whole-file write from one session dropped two other
#   lanes' rows and a day of Rule 6 LANDED lines, and there was no history to
#   recover from. Every write now goes through this script (or an equivalent
#   single-line in-place edit followed by commit + pull --rebase + push), so the
#   registry has a history and a lost row is one `git show` away.
#
# HAZARD — `sed -i` REPLACES A SYMLINK WITH A REGULAR FILE.
#   ~/projects/xFactory/LANES.md is a SYMLINK into this worktree. Plain
#   `sed -i` unlinks it and writes a new regular file, silently detaching the
#   registry from git. Use this helper, or `sed -i --follow-symlinks`, or
#   `cat tmp > LANES.md` (a redirect follows the symlink). `>>` appends,
#   `cat`, `cut`, `head`, `tail`, `grep`, `python open(...,'a')` are all safe.

#   lanes-edit.sh                      archive-rows       <repo> [--yes]      # Amendment 19(d)
#
# AMENDMENT 19 — A CLOSED OR DORMANT LANE LEAVES THE LISTING
#   lanes-edit.sh lanes [--closed]                 # CLOSED and DORMANT rows too
#   lane-end --retire-dormant <repo> [--reason "<why>"] [--yes]
#   lanes-edit.sh archive-rows <repo> [--yes]
#
#   CLOSED is a lane whose object log's last lane-kind line is `ENDED` or
#   `RETIRED`; DORMANT is a ROW WITH NO OBJECT LOG and no live session here —
#   the rows that predate Amendment 7 and that no `lane-end` can close, because
#   it wants a live session or a log to write into. `lanes` lists neither by
#   default; `--closed` adds them, and the NEXT FREE POSITION is computed over
#   every row of the repository — the hidden ones and the archive included — so
#   a retired `<repo>-<n>` is never reissued.
#
#   `lane-end --retire-dormant <repo>` is a DRY RUN that names every dormant row
#   of that repository with its start, its workstation and its state cell's
#   head, and FLAGS the cells that say the work was unpushed, lost, a loss or
#   owed, or that still say LIVE. With `--yes` it is ONE commit — `retire-rows`
#   below it — creating each lane's log with a single `RETIRED` line that
#   carries the row's own last words, and setting the row's state to
#   `RETIRED · <UTC> · <why>; was: <head>`.
#
# AMENDMENT 13 — THE ROW IS CURRENT STATE; THE LOG IS HISTORY
#   lanes-edit.sh set-row-state <lane> "<STATE> · <one line>"
#   lanes-edit.sh log NOTED lane:<lane> "<what the lane did, found, launched, left>"
#   lanes-edit.sh log RULED lane:<lane> [→ <object>] "<Brett Heap's words, verbatim>"
#   lanes-edit.sh history <lane> [--since <UTC>]
#   lanes-edit.sh migrate-state-cells [--yes]
#
#   The `state` column holds ONE PHRASE — `<STATE> · <UTC> · <one line>` — and
#   every write REPLACES it. `set-row-state` stamps the UTC itself; the STATE is
#   one of LIVE, PAUSED, LANDING #<n>, LANDED, ENDED, RETIRED, HANDED OFF (Rule
#   6's reading of the cell is unchanged and is now the whole of what the cell
#   says at that moment), and the line is at most 240 characters (ratified
#   decision O1) carrying neither a `|` nor a second ` · `.
#
#   `append-row-status` is RETIRED and refuses, naming these. It appended and
#   never replaced, which is how the column that says where a lane IS came to
#   hold 96,228 characters in one row and 7,016 in another after ONE day — a
#   diary in a table nobody can read in the table.
#
#   THE NARRATIVE GOES TO THE LANE'S OWN LOG, under two Amendment 7 verbs that
#   are lane-kind lines and NOT transitions: `NOTED` is a status note and
#   `RULED` a ruling recorded verbatim, with the object it bears on as its
#   payload where there is one. Neither ever changes a lane's state on any
#   object or on itself — `who`, `lane-end`, `lanes` and `swapped` skip them
#   exactly as they skip `STARTED` and `RESUMED` — and `history` prints them in
#   file order, which is the diary the cell used to be.
#
#   `migrate-state-cells` is clause (e)'s ONE act, on Brett Heap's word: a DRY
#   RUN by default, and with `--yes` one commit carrying the archive
#   `lanes/archive/LANES-pre-amendment-13-<UTC>.md`, every lane's log and the
#   register. It REFUSES when no cell holds a ` · ` entry, so a second run is a
#   no-op that says so.
#
# AMENDMENT 7 — the per-lane object log (`lanes/log/<lane>.md`)
#   lanes-edit.sh log     <VERB> <object> [→|← <payload>] ["<text>"] [--text "<t>"]
#   lanes-edit.sh claim   <object> [--force] [--no-github] [--home owner/repo]
#   lanes-edit.sh release <object> ["<why>"] [--no-github] [--home owner/repo]
#   lanes-edit.sh who     <object> | --lane <lane> | --landing owner/repo
#
# AMENDMENT 8 — swap and restart, the READ side (both read-only, never write)
#   lanes-edit.sh swapped       [<workstation>]
#   lanes-edit.sh session-start                  # the SessionStart hook; JSON on stdin
#
# AMENDMENT 12 — the name guard and the lock (the blocking hook)
#   lanes-edit.sh guard                          # the UserPromptSubmit hook; JSON on stdin
#
#   `guard` is the ONLY verb here that refuses a person's work. It reads the
#   hook's JSON, takes the WINDOW from tmux, the SESSION's own name from the
#   live record and the ROW from `origin/<branch>`, and where the three are not
#   one name it REFUSES THE PROMPT (exit 2) with the triple and the one command
#   that cures it. THE LOCK types `/rename <lane>` into this pane for the TWO
#   drifts that are not decisions — a name differing from the row's only by
#   CASE, which is the same lane under Amendment 15, and a name that is a
#   FORMER name of the row's lane, which is the same lane under Amendment
#   16(e) and is what a rename run from another window leaves behind. EVERY
#   OTHER READABLE MISMATCH IS AN OFFER OF THREE CHOICES, answered `1` (allow
#   this lane for this transcript), `2` (adjust the lane to the session) or `3`
#   (adjust the session to the lane, which types the `/rename`) at the next
#   prompt; an answer to a question the state has moved past is dropped rather
#   than acted on, and the unreadable, ambiguous, duplicate and superseded still
#   refuse outright. It is silent and cheap where the three agree, silent
#   outside `$PROJECTS_ROOT` and silent for a subagent's prompt.
#
# AMENDMENT 16 — a lane is renamed by ONE WORD, in ONE COMMIT, and its old name
# resolves for ever
#   lanes-edit.sh rename-lane <old> <new> ["<why>"] [--verbatim] [--no-github]
#
#   `lane-rename <old> <new>` on PATH is the word; this is its write. ONE
#   commit, refused or whole, and its four moves are the amendment's clauses
#   (b)–(e): the row's key cell becomes `` `<new>` `` with `*(ex `<old>`,
#   renamed <UTC>)*` beside it; `lanes/log/<old>.md` is renamed to
#   `lanes/log/<new>.md` and gains a `RENAMED` line; the handoff the row names
#   is renamed to the same date with `lane-<new>` and gains a Rule 3 stamp,
#   with the row's handoff column following; and `lanes/aliases.tsv` gains
#   `<old>	<new>	<UTC>`.
#
#   THE ALIAS TABLE IS WHAT MAKES THE OLD NAME KEEP WORKING (clause (e)).
#   `canon_lane` — Amendment 15's resolver, which every `<lane>` argument and
#   every `$LANES_LANE` already passes through — resolves a name with NO ROW
#   through that table, case-insensitively, chains to their end, before it
#   answers. So an old name in a line, a window, a session record or a person's
#   typing lands on the current row, in every reader at once, rather than in a
#   list of readers somebody has to keep complete. A ROW WINS OVER AN ALIAS:
#   a name that is a lane today IS that lane, which is also what makes a rename
#   back again readable.
#
#   `RENAMED` is a LANE-KIND verb that changes no object's state. Every
#   last-line state reader here enumerates the five verbs that DO
#   (`STARTED PAUSED RESUMED ENDED RETIRED`), so the new verb is outside that
#   rule by construction and no reader had to be taught to skip it.
#
# AMENDMENT 18 — ONE BINDING PER LANE
#   lanes-edit.sh binding <lane>                 # where this lane is bound
#   lanes-edit.sh request-handoff <lane> [--wait <s>] [--session <uuid>]
#   lanes-edit.sh request-handoff <lane> --force "<why>"
#
#   A lane's BINDING is the `host`, `container` and `window` of its last
#   `STARTED`/`RESUMED` with no `PAUSED`/`ENDED`/`RETIRED` after it, and those
#   three sub-fields are written by `write_event` beside Amendment 11(c)'s
#   `dir`/`profile`/`window` — read from `LANES_HOST`/`LANES_OS`/
#   `LANES_CONTAINER`, which the launcher exports, with clause (a)'s fallbacks.
#   **Liveness is pronounced only from inside the binding's own host and
#   container**: from anywhere else it is UNKNOWN and never dead, whatever
#   `kill -0` of a pid in another namespace would say. The ONE exception is a
#   window that is gone from a tmux server the two share, which is dead and is
#   today's takeover path. A second place ASKS — `request-handoff` writes the
#   line and pushes it, types `/handoff --exit requested by …` into the bound
#   pane where that pane is here, and waits; an empty wait refuses with the
#   facts and names `--force`, which is a second invocation that releases the
#   binding on the bound session's behalf in the requester's own session field.
#   The prompt guard answers both from the bound side (clauses (d) and (e)).
#
# AMENDMENT 18(h) — one live process per transcript
#   lanes-edit.sh transcript-holders <uuid>      # every live process carrying it
#
#   A transcript is held by ONE live process; the harness can fork one or resume
#   one twice. This read is what `lane-start` asks before it binds or resumes an
#   id, what `lane-end <lane> --retire <pid>` proves a duplicate with, and what
#   `guard` refuses a prompt on. It sweeps EVERY profile's `sessions/`, because a
#   duplicate's record sits in another profile's — measured four times on
#   2026-09-14.
#
#   A SWAP is a planned stop — a usage reset, a profile switch — and a RESTART
#   is the launch that follows it. The RECORD a swap leaves is not a new file:
#   it is the lane's own `PAUSED` line, payload
#   `swap; window <tmux session>:<index>; workstation <ws>`. A lane is SWAPPED
#   on a workstation when that PAUSED is its LAST lane-kind line — no later
#   RESUMED, STARTED, ENDED or RETIRED — and `swapped` lists those lanes, which
#   is how a restart finds its lane once the new tmux session has lost the
#   window name. `session-start` is the whole output of the SessionStart hook:
#   it resolves the lane from the tmux window name, else from the session id in
#   the hook's JSON, prints ONE block, and ALWAYS exits 0 — a hook that fails
#   is a hook that breaks the session it was meant to orient.
#
# AMENDMENT 17 — the handoff is the swap, and the record names the agent
#   lanes-edit.sh lane-agent      <lane>    # the last record's `agent <name>`
#   lanes-edit.sh lane-transcript <lane>    # its `transcript <id|none>`
#   lanes-edit.sh lane-last       <lane>    # its LAST lane-kind line, as
#                                           # <verb><TAB><utc><TAB><session><TAB><payload>
#   lanes-edit.sh workspace-root            # the workspace repository's path
#   lanes-edit.sh log PAUSED … --utc <UTC>  # date a LATE record by its own field
#
#   Clause (b) gives the `PAUSED` payload two sub-fields beside Amendment
#   11(c)'s `window`, `dir` and `profile`: `agent <name>` — `claude`, `codex`,
#   or the launcher's name for whatever wrote the line, a manifest key (letters,
#   digits, `.`, `_`, `-`) — and `transcript <id|none>`, the agent's own
#   resumable id where it has one. THE WRITER VALIDATES BOTH (`pause_subfields_check`,
#   called from `write_event`) because the log is append-only: a malformed
#   sub-field there is malformed for ever, and `lane-start --agent` launches on
#   what it reads. `swapped` prints them as its sixth and seventh fields, after
#   the five it already had, and a record written before this amendment carries
#   neither — which is EMPTY in that output and 8 from the two reads, never a
#   guess (Amendment 7(i)'s cutover rule).
#
#   `--utc <UTC>` IS FOR THE LATE RECORD AND NOTHING ELSE (adoption act 7): the
#   `PAUSED` a swap never left, written after the fact and dated by the moment
#   the old session ENDED rather than by the clock of the shell writing it. It
#   changes which instant the line NAMES and never where the line goes: the log
#   is append-only and FILE ORDER is what every state read means by "last", so
#   `lane-handoff --late` refuses to write one that would land after the
#   relaunch's `RESUMED` — a lane that is running must never read as paused.
#
#   `--home owner/repo` is an option of all FIVE of `claim`, `release`, `who`,
#   `log` and `lane-end`, for a lane whose log has no STARTED line. All five
#   resolve it AFTER the fetch (R30), because the STARTED line that refuses it
#   may be a peer's and live only on `origin/<branch>`.
#
#   An object is `owner/repo#<n>`, `owner/repo:openspec/changes/<name>`, `#<n>`
#   for the lane's OWN home repo, or `lane:<name>` for the lane-kind lines.
#   `lanes/repos.tsv` (`alias<TAB>owner/repo`) resolves an omitted owner and
#   the register's legacy spellings; an unknown alias is refused, never guessed.
#   A LANE'S HOME GOES THROUGH THE SAME TABLE (R20, Addendum 5) — `lane-start`
#   resolves it before writing STARTED, and every comparison of an object's
#   repository against a home resolves BOTH sides. A home is inherited by every
#   `#<n>` that lane writes, so a legacy org spelling there gave one GitHub
#   issue two object keys and two lanes held it with no collision detected.
#
#   STATE IS PER LANE: a lane's state on an object is its own LAST line naming
#   it, and it HOLDS the object while that verb is open. Open is
#   {CLAIMED, TAKEOVER, OPENED, LANDING, WITHDRAWN}; closed — and it closes
#   only the writing lane's hold — is {RELEASED, CLAIM-LOST, CLOSED, LANDED}.
#
#   THAT APPLIES TO A TAKEOVER TOO (R18, Addendum 5): lane B's TAKEOVER on an
#   object supersedes lane A's CLAIMED only while the TAKEOVER is B's OWN LAST
#   LINE on it. Once B writes RELEASED, CLOSED or LANDED there, A's later
#   CLAIMED holds normally. A TAKEOVER is never removed from an append-only
#   log, so treating one as superseding for ever made a legitimate re-claim
#   invisible: `who` called a held object FREE and `claim` did not refuse the
#   next lane. Known and deliberate: two lanes each ending on a TAKEOVER of one
#   object are BOTH reported as holders — a visible conflict, and not reachable
#   through the helpers, since `claim --force` takes over a stale CLAIMED only.
#
#   AND "LAST" IS THE LAST LINE IN THE FILE (R14, Addendum 4). A lane's log is
#   append-only and single-writer, so the ORDER OF ITS LINES is the order of
#   that lane's writes. No state read here — `lane_objects`, `superseded_by`,
#   PER_LANE_AWK, `who` in any mode, `lane-end`'s refusal, `claim`'s pre-check
#   and its rescan — selects or orders lines by their UTC field. The UTC stays
#   on every line as INFORMATION, and is compared only where a DURATION is the
#   rule: Rule 1's four-hour staleness and Rule 6's thirty minutes, where a few
#   seconds are immaterial. On 2026-09-11 this workstation's realtime clock was
#   observed jumping ±25s in bursts and a log commit landed whose content
#   carried a UTC 26s after its own committer date; a max-UTC read made that
#   lane's newest line invisible. Two workstations never share a clock either.
#
#   `claim` is Rule 1 as one act, and THE RACE IS DECIDED BY WHICH CLAIMED
#   LANDS ON `main` FIRST, never by comparing timestamps: fetch, pre-check
#   against `origin/main`, append, commit, push; on a rebase, rescan, and if
#   another lane's claim is already there, write `CLAIM-LOST` and stop. Git's
#   push serialization is the arbiter between workstations; the `mkdir` mutex
#   below only serializes this one.
#
#   EVERY STATE READ IS OF `origin/<branch>`, AFTER A FETCH — never of the
#   working tree. What has LANDED is what other lanes can see; a working tree
#   can be behind by a peer's whole day. `who`, the pre-check, staleness, the
#   superseded filter, the crossing warning, `lane-end`'s refusal and
#   `lane-start`'s home lookup all read the same source, so they cannot
#   disagree with each other either.
#
#   THE REGISTER'S ROWS ARE READ THE SAME WAY (R19, Addendum 5). The session
#   cell, the handoff path and the workstation column come from
#   `git show origin/<branch>:lanes/LANES.md`; nothing in `who` reads the
#   working tree. THE ONE EXCEPTION IS THE `live-holder` SUBCOMMAND, and only
#   its id SET (R25, Addendum 6): it is the published row's union this
#   checkout's, because a session stamps its uuid on the row with
#   `replace-in-row` and that write is a LOCAL COMMIT until its push lands —
#   read from `origin` alone the rename gate would not see the uuid of the very
#   session it is being asked to rename over, would answer 8, and `lane-start`
#   would take the name. That is what mints `<lane> (2)` (AGENTS.md rule 7).
#   Liveness fails closed, so an id `origin` has not seen is a reason to refuse
#   a rename, never to allow one, and nothing that PRINTS uses the union.
#
#   A LANDED CLOSES THE LANDING IT ANSWERS (R17, Addendum 5): `who --landing`
#   pairs them by (lane, PR) in FILE ORDER and keys the result on
#   (lane, repository, PR). Most of the register's LANDED lines carry no
#   `into <repo> main` clause, and keying those on the repository they name
#   reported 232 phantom merge holds where one was real.

#
#   A lane is RUNNING, SWAPPING, SWAPPED or CLOSED, and WHICH OF THOSE IT IS
#   WITH NO LIVE HOLDER is what says where its session stopped: `RUNNING` with
#   no holder is an UNGRACEFUL STOP (nothing was handed off) and `SWAPPING`
#   with no holder is an INTERRUPTED SWAP (the handoff began and did not
#   finish). Every transition carries a monotonic `generation` and a unique
#   `operation`, and `--expect*` is the compare-and-swap that refuses a stale
#   finalizer with exit 7 rather than letting it overwrite a newer owner.
#
#   NO LANE-KIND VERB IS ADDED TO THE APPEND-ONLY LOG BY THIS CHANGE. Amendment
#   7's five state verbs stand and every reader of them is untouched (Amendment
#   18(g) has since added a sixth lane-kind verb, `HANDOFF-REQUESTED`, which
#   changes no state; this adds none). This is a SNAPSHOT beside that
#   history, local to the workstation, replaced atomically, and never committed
#   — see the section above the dispatcher for where it lives and why it is
#   neither in the register nor inside a git worktree.
#
#   `set-lane-tree` records ONE worktree of the lane — its path, checkout,
#   branch, head, upstream, dirty and unpushed counts and writer — as an
#   OBSERVATION; `lane-reconcile` recomputes every one of them and REPORTS the
#   difference. It resets nothing, deletes nothing and creates nothing: a
#   missing tree's only rebuild is the estate's own `resume <Name>`, and a
#   missing tree that last held uncommitted work is reported as possible loss,
#   because no metadata reconstructs a file's contents.
#
#   `lane-tree-now` IS THAT OBSERVATION ON ITS OWN, and it is here so that the
#   handoff's WRITERS section, the sidecar it files and the reconciliation that
#   recomputes against it are one implementation with one error handling. A git
#   read that FAILED is never converted into a clean-looking value by any of the
#   three: `unknown`, `none` and `0` are answers, and the reads that could not
#   be made are said instead (R22, Amendment 7(d)).
#
#   THE TWO WRITERS REFUSE A SIDECAR THEY CANNOT READ. A snapshot or a tree
#   record carrying a schema this helper does not write is never replaced — a
#   reader that fails closed and a writer that walks past it protect nothing —
#   and `set-lane-tree`'s `--generation`/`--operation` are COMPARED with the
#   lane's own snapshot under the mutex before the record is filed, so a poll
#   from an operation a recovery has superseded cannot be filed over the
#   current one.
#
# THE SEAM — A MANAGED-OWNED LANE IS NOT THIS TOOLING'S (Brett Heap's ruling of
# 2026-10-04, verbatim: "managed ledger owns enrolled lanes; #97 owns legacy —
# rework both")
#   lanes-edit.sh managed-projection <lane>
#
#   0 with the owner on stdout where the lane's register row carries a valid
#   managed-owner marker, 8 where it carries none (a LEGACY lane, which is
#   every lane today), 1 where it carries managed-owner vocabulary that does
#   not parse as a marker or the register could not be read (ownership
#   UNKNOWN), 64 usage. Every legacy act that would write for a lane asks this
#   first and refuses a managed lane with 2 and an unknown one with 1, before
#   a byte is written: the lane-kind lines `log` writes (STARTED, RESUMED,
#   ENDED, RETIRED), `set-lane-state`, `set-lane-tree`, `retire-rows`,
#   `set-row-state`, `replace-in-row` and `rename-lane`, the entry of
#   `lane-start` and `lane-handoff`, and `lane-end` before its first act on
#   each of its paths. `lane-reconcile` pronounces
#   nothing on a managed lane (`VERDICT managed-owned`), and no legacy writer
#   may write the marker's vocabulary into a row at all.
#
# EXIT CODES — every subcommand, one table, no two meanings on one number
#   0  done
#   1  environment (no register, no writer)
#   2  refusal: bad arguments, the object is held, an unknown alias, a
#      checkout that cannot be rebased, — Amendment 15 — a register holding
#      two rows whose lane names differ only by case, which every writer and
#      `canon-lane` refuse until 15(d)'s merge, or AMENDMENT 12's BLOCKED
#      PROMPT. SIX MEANINGS ON ONE NUMBER, and they
#      stay readable only because of where each can occur: bad arguments to a
#      subcommand that predates Amendment 11; `register-row`'s "not lane-shaped";
#      AN UNKNOWN SUBCOMMAND (the `*)` arm below), which is how a caller detects
#      a helper predating the amendment that added the read it asked for; and
#      Amendment 11's container refusal. The last is on WRITERS ONLY (the
#      dispatcher guard), so no READ can return it and clause (h)'s
#      fall-to-the-next-rung rule is unaffected by it.
#      THE SIXTH IS NOT THIS FILE'S NUMBER AT ALL: 2 is what a `UserPromptSubmit`
#      hook must exit to BLOCK a prompt (code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks), so
#      `guard` spends the one number the harness reads, and every refusal it
#      makes — a mismatch, an unreadable read, a pending offer's question and
#      its answer — is that 2. `guard` never exits anything else but 0.
#  64  usage — a caller's bad arguments to one of the reads Amendment 11 added
#      (`window-lane`, `lane-dir`, `lane-profile`, `last-session`, `forks`,
#      `duplicate-holder` (issue #39), `workstation`, `fetch-age`, `lanes`,
#      `session-lane`, and `swapped`, which
#      took it first), to Amendment 13's `history`, and to Amendment 15's
#      `canon-lane`, which takes the same
#      contract because its four callers sit in front of a launch as those do. IT WAS IN NO TABLE AT ALL until this round (F-X16), while
#      being the code the contract gives every one of those reads.
#
#  66  EX_NOINPUT — AMENDMENT 16(e)'s ALIAS TABLE COULD NOT BE READ, and
#      `canon-lane` is the one verb that spends it. `lanes/aliases.tsv` is what
#      makes a renamed lane's OLD name resolve, so a table nobody can read is
#      not an estate with no renames: a former name would read as a lane nobody
#      has, and `lane-start` would append a SECOND row for one that has been
#      running all day. It is a number of its own because 2 already carries two
#      meanings to `lane-start`, `lane-end`, `lane` and `lane-handoff` — 15(d)'s
#      two-rows refusal, told by its words, and the unknown-subcommand 2 of an
#      older helper, which they carry on past — and a third meaning there is the
#      fail-open this refusal exists to close.
#
#      WHY A SECOND USAGE CODE RATHER THAN 2. A read in front of a launch has to
#      tell "you called me wrong" from "this helper has never heard of you" —
#      and the second of those IS a 2, emitted by the `*)` arm, on every
#      workstation until adoption act 3's install reaches it. One number cannot
#      carry both without the caller guessing, so the newer reads spend a number
#      of their own and the older half of this file keeps 2 where it always was.
#      Clause (h)'s table is the contract for which read uses which.
#   3  the edit is never a permanent loss, but this attempt cannot confirm
#      whether it also reached origin. THREE CAUSES (Copilot round 3 on #50,
#      5203261904, naming the other two this row used to leave out): a
#      rebase conflict this attempt could not resolve — not pushed BY THIS
#      ATTEMPT; a later write from this checkout may already carry it to
#      origin, so LOOK by CONTENT before you retry (round 4, 5203455553:
#      SHA ancestry alone misses a peer's rebase of it, which changes the
#      hash but not the patch); `git_timeout_die`'s network timeout on a
#      push OR a pull, where a hung one often already landed; or six
#      attempts exhausted because a peer's own uncommitted file blocks
#      every rebase.
#   4  the mutex could not be taken within 60s
#   5  an edit moved more than one line and was refused — or, Amendment 15, a
#      lane's object log could not be renamed to the row's own spelling
#   6  git add / commit / push failed
#   7  ANOTHER ACT GOT THERE FIRST, and this one wrote nothing. `claim`:
#      CLAIM-LOST, another lane's claim landed on main first.
#      `set-lane-state`: the lifecycle fence did not match — the state, the
#      generation or the operation id moved under this process — so a stale
#      finalizer cannot overwrite a newer owner (openRepoTools#91).
#      `set-lane-tree`: the `--generation`/`--operation` this observation was
#      taken under is no longer the lane's, so a superseded poll cannot be filed
#      over the current inventory. ONE MEANING ON THE NUMBER, in three places:
#      you lost the race.
#   8  no record — `who` found nothing; `lane-objects` has no log file for the
#      lane; `live-holder` READ this workstation's session records and none of
#      them holds it; `swapped` found no lane swapped on the workstation;
#      `history` READ the lane's log and it carries no `NOTED` or `RULED` line;
#      `window-session` found no live session in the window. A read that could
#      not be performed is never 8 (R22). `session-start` never exits 8, or
#      anything but 0: it is a hook. `guard` never exits 8 either — it is a hook
#      too, and a BLOCKING one, so its two codes are 0 and 2 (see 2 above).
#   9  CLAIM-LOST — issue #30's own dead-lane verdict could not be
#      reconfirmed before this takeover's push landed: the source lane's own
#      log moved past its terminal line, a live session on this workstation
#      now backs it up, or that could not be read at all (`claim` only,
#      `--force` over a dead lane's hold). NEVER coerced to 7: that code
#      means a RIVAL's claim landed first, and this is the same lane the
#      takeover was granted over, alive again rather than beaten to main.
#  10  THE RECORD IS THERE AND COULD NOT BE READ, which is the other half of 8
#      and never 8 itself (Copilot round 6 on openRepoTools#97). `lane-state`
#      spends it for a lifecycle snapshot that EXISTS at the control root and
#      cannot be opened — a permission, an I/O error, a name whose bytes are
#      gone. 8 says *this lane has no snapshot*, which a launcher answers by
#      going on; 10 says *this lane may be mid-crash and nobody could look*,
#      which it answers by reading the lane by hand. One number could not carry
#      both, and the one that was carrying both was 8 (R22, Amendment 7(d)).
#      IT WAS 9 until main's #61 landed with 9 as `claim --force`'s abandoned
#      takeover; each PR had taken 9 as unused, and the later one moved.
#
# --no-sweep (DEFAULT, added 2026-09-09 after 0d84d34/a1f2438 swept another
#   lane's uncommitted hand edit into an unrelated commit): every mutating
#   subcommand checks, before making its own edit, whether LANES.md is
#   already dirty. If it is, that content is someone else's — never this
#   invocation's — so it is committed FIRST, on its own, as
#   `LANES(pre-existing@<workstation>): capture an uncommitted registry edit
#   (row <lane>)`, before this invocation's own edit is made and committed.
#   A WARNING (with `git diff --stat` and the first 200 chars of every
#   changed line) always prints first. This never fails the call — the
#   write still goes through. Amendment 7's `log`, `claim` and `release` take
#   the same capture for the REGISTER between the two halves of their
#   dirty-checkout guard, which is why a peer's half-written `lanes/LANES.md`
#   does not refuse them (Addendum 3, R11); any OTHER modified tracked file
#   still does, and is refused before the capture rather than after it.
# --sweep — the old behaviour: leave the pre-existing content staged so it
#   lands inside this invocation's own commit. Still warns exactly as above,
#   and appends " + sweeps uncommitted edit to row <lane>" to the commit
#   subject, so the sweep is never silent.
# `commit` has no edit of its own to separate from a pre-existing one — its
#   job IS to wrap whatever is already dirty. It instead warns and appends
#   the same " + sweeps uncommitted edit to row <lane>" note when the dirty
#   content touches a row other than the caller's own $LANES_LANE.

# --- THE WORKSPACE REPOSITORY (lane-collision-protocol Amendment 9(a)) -------
#
# The person's data — the register `lanes/LANES.md`, the object logs
# `lanes/log/`, the handoffs, the manifests `park` writes, and a
# `lanes/repos.tsv` override — is found through
# `$AGENT_PROTOCOL_ROOT/workspace.yaml`, and NEVER from this file's own
# location. `resume:466` and `status:1673` already read that same file under
# that same name, and Amendment 9(a) mints no second one: a second way to find
# it is a second answer.
#
# Deriving it from here stopped being POSSIBLE the moment this became an
# installed regular file in `~/.local/bin` with no register anywhere near it,
# and it stopped being WANTED for a subtler reason: a file's location on disk
# is evidence about the file, not about a person's data.
#
# THESE FOUR FUNCTIONS ARE A DELIBERATE COPY, byte for byte, across
# `lanes-edit.sh`, `lane-start`, `lane-end` and `link-estates` — the same trade
# openRepoTools already makes for its own fetch shim (`openRepoTools:93-100`).
# A shared `lanes-common.sh` would be a TENTH file for `--install` to place and
# a broken helper the first time somebody copied only some of them. Each of
# these is one file a person has on PATH.
#
# FAILING TO FIND IT IS A REFUSAL, NEVER A GUESS. No file, no `path:`, no
# `repository:`, or a `path:` that is not the root of a checkout of the
# `repository:` named beside it → the caller refuses, exit 1 — the code
# `lanes-edit.sh` has always used for *registry not found* — with the fix
# named: `openRepoTools wip init`. Nothing here ever creates that file, writes
# a register, or falls back to a path derived from its own location. THE
# CHECKOUT TEST IS NEW: nothing validated it before this, so a `path:` pointing
# at some other repository used to be accepted and now is not.
#
# `LANES_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is the test seam and the only override — the seam
# `lane-start` already spelled for handoff resolution, widened to the whole
# question so `test_lane_helpers.sh` can point every helper at one sandbox.
# --- BEGIN shared workspace resolver (Amendment 9(a)) ----------------------
# BYTE-IDENTICAL IN ALL FOUR LANE HELPERS, and held there by
# `tests/test_repo_hygiene.py`. The estate commands carry the same discipline
# for their own estate resolver and for the same reason its guard gives: a
# drifted copy is TWO ANSWERS to one question, and "where is this person's
# workspace" is exactly the question Amendment 9(a) exists to give one answer
# to. Edit it in one file and the test names the other three.

# THE WORKSTATION'S NAME IS READ, NEVER INVENTED — AND NEVER `hostname` INSIDE A
# CONTAINER (lane-collision-protocol Amendment 11, ratified decision 8(d), as
# corrected by A11 Addendum 3's `R-A11-14`).
#
# WHAT WENT WRONG. `opensoft/brett-wip` `origin/main` carries SIX lines in
# `lanes/log/openRepoProject-1.md` whose workstation is a container id — five
# `@0e7d1a79a07e`, one `@55cceb3e5bc9` — in an append-only file, written by every
# writer inside that container and not only by Evidence 6's fork. A row on a
# workstation that does not exist is a row no reader can match, no crossing can
# detect and no `swapped <ws>` can answer for; and the log is never rewritten, so
# each one is wrong for ever.
#
# WHO OWNS THE VALUE. `R-A11-14`: the **workBenches launcher**, which runs on the
# host and exports `LANES_WORKSTATION=<the host's own hostname -s>` into every
# session AND every container it starts, beside the `CLAUDE_PROFILE_NAME` it
# already exports. These helpers READ it. They do not write it, they do not
# derive it from a second file, and THEY NEVER SUBSTITUTE A PLACEHOLDER: an
# `@unknown-workstation` is the same defect one field along from the `unknown`
# clause (e) refuses in the session field, and the rejected alternative — a
# `workstation:` key in `workspace.yaml` — is a SECOND PLACE FOR THE TRUTH TO BE
# WRONG beside the variable the launcher already sets.
#
# THE THREE ANSWERS, as `<name><TAB><source>`:
#
#   seam              `$LANES_WORKSTATION` is set. This is the ordinary case
#                     wherever the launcher started the session.
#   hostname          no seam, and this is NOT a container: `hostname -s`, which
#                     is what the seam has defaulted to since Amendment 6 and
#                     what every row written before this rung was written by.
#   container-unset   no seam, and this IS a container. The NAME still answers,
#                     because a read in front of every launch may not refuse —
#                     it will simply match nothing, which is the honest answer —
#                     but every WRITER refuses, exit 2, naming the variable and
#                     the launcher that sets it.
#
# IT ANSWERS AS A PAIR, AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. A caller reads the name
# with `$(lanes_workstation)`, which is a COMMAND SUBSTITUTION and therefore a
# subshell: a global the function set there dies with it. The source is on the
# same line as the name, which is the only way out of a subshell there is.
#

# ======================= AMENDMENT 18(a) — WHERE THE LANE IS ================
#
# **A LANE HAS ONE BINDING, AND THE RECORD SAYS WHERE IT IS.** Ratified
# 2026-09-14T13:15:18Z as revision 4; `brettheap/new-workstation#34`/#35,
# opensoft/openRepoTools#38. Clause (a) gives the lane-kind payload three
# sub-fields beside Amendment 11(c)'s `window`, `dir` and `profile`:
#
#   host <name>       the MACHINE's short hostname as it reads OUTSIDE any
#                     container. The launcher exports it (`LANES_HOST`); a
#                     writer outside a container reads `hostname -s`; a writer
#                     INSIDE one with no export writes the Rule 10 workstation
#                     name, because in this estate a workstation is one host and
#                     a container's own `hostname` is its id.
#   os <linux|macos|wsl|windows>
#                     the HOST's operating system as the person means it. The
#                     launcher exports it (`LANES_OS`); with no export the
#                     kernel is probed: `Darwin` -> macos; `Linux` whose
#                     `/proc/version` names `microsoft` -> wsl; one naming
#                     `linuxkit` -> macos (Docker Desktop's VM); any other
#                     `Linux` -> linux. `windows` is written ONLY by a launcher
#                     on the Windows host itself — this toolset is bash and runs
#                     in WSL2 there, so its own probe never says it.
#   container <name|none>
#                     the bench's name as the launcher exports it
#                     (`LANES_CONTAINER`: `py-bench`, `cloud-bench`, …); inside
#                     a container with no export, THAT CONTAINER'S OWN
#                     `hostname`, which for Docker's default is its id — a true
#                     name of that container and the one thing that tells two
#                     unnamed containers apart; outside every container, `none`.
#
# WHY THE RULE EXISTS AT ALL, in the amendment's own words: *"a pid does not
# cross a pid namespace, and the tooling pretends it does."* Two bench
# containers on one host share the profile directory, so pyBench can read a
# session record cloudBench wrote and then `kill -0` a pid in cloudBench's
# namespace — which is either nothing or some other process. A lane live and
# writing in cloudBench reads NOT LIVE from pyBench, and `lane-start` there took
# the name. The three facts are what let a reader say UNKNOWN instead.
#
# READ LIVE, EVERY TIME, AND NEVER CACHED — MEASURED 2026-09-15T12:17Z. This
# bench container was recreated with a new hostname (`cb999b9fd177`) and its
# `~/.local/bin` was wiped with it. A container's `hostname` names THIS
# container for as long as it exists and names nothing afterwards, so it is
# asked at the moment a line is written and is never carried in a variable
# across a run, let alone read back out of a record as though it were the
# workstation's name. A binding written by a container that has since been
# recreated therefore does NOT match this one — which is correct, because its
# pid namespace went with it — and the window-gone exception in clause (b) is
# what makes such a binding readable as dead rather than stranding the lane.
#
# EACH ANSWERS AS A PAIR, `<value><TAB><source>`, for the reason
# `lanes_workstation_pair` states: a caller reads the value with `$( … )`, which
# is a subshell, so a global the function set there dies with it. The source is
# what `workstation` prints in its two new columns.
#
# NOT IN THE SHARED RESOLVER BLOCK ABOVE, deliberately. That block is
# byte-identical in four files and `tests/test_repo_hygiene.py` holds it there;
# these three are read by the WRITER and by the reads built on it, all of which
# are in this file, so a fourth copy would be three more places for one answer
# to be given differently.

# `hostname -s` where there is one, else `hostname`, else empty. BSD and GNU
# both take `-s`; a busybox one may not, and an empty answer is honest.

# ====================================================== AMENDMENT 16 =======
#
# THE RENAME'S UNDO, AND WHY IT IS A TRAP AND NOT A LINE BEFORE EACH `die`.
#
# `rename-lane` is ONE COMMIT, REFUSED OR WHOLE, and its refusals all happen
# before the first byte — but the four MOVES themselves can still fail on a
# filesystem: a `mv` across a mount, a handoff this user may not write, a disk
# that fills between the log and the alias table. Copilot round 1 on
# openRepoTools#81 named the state that left: *"the log has already been moved
# and its `RENAMED` line appended, and this `die` exits without rolling either
# change back"* — a half-renamed checkout, which is exactly what the contract
# says cannot happen and what no re-run can finish.
#
# So the writes are made against a SNAPSHOT taken before the first of them, and
# every exit path between the first write and the commit restores it. It hangs
# off `cleanup`, not off each `die`, for the reason `replace_line` makes
# unavoidable: that function dies inside itself when its own proof fails, and a
# caller cannot put a line after it. `cleanup` runs on EXIT and on the two
# signals, so one hook covers every way out, the shell's included.
#
# THE REGISTER IS NOT IN IT. `replace_line` builds the new file in a temporary
# directory and proves it — one line added, one removed, the same line count —
# BEFORE it writes a byte of `LANES.md`, so the register is never half-written
# and there is nothing there to restore.

# openxfactory 2` typed in lowercase for the lane `openXfactory-2` found NO row
# here — the row key was the one exact comparison left in this file — and
# appended a SECOND row for a lane that had run since 2026-09-02, while its
# object log went on into the one file both spellings had always shared.

# --------------------------------------------- AMENDMENT 13: THE ROW IS STATE
#
# **THE ROW IS THE LANE'S CURRENT STATE, ONE LINE A PERSON CAN READ; ITS HISTORY
# IS THE LANE'S OWN LOG** — lane-collision-protocol Amendment 13, in force
# 2026-09-13T21:08:36Z. Clause (a): the `state` column holds ONE PHRASE,
# `<STATE> · <UTC> · <one line>`, and every write REPLACES it. `set-row-state`
# is the writer; `append-row-status` is RETIRED, so the cell can never grow into
# a diary again. Measured on the day the amendment was drafted: the register was
# 1,141,283 bytes over 46 rows, its longest row 96,228 characters, and this
# lane's own cell 7,016 characters after ONE day of appending.
#
# WHERE THE CELL IS: SPLIT THE ROW ON ` | `, AND SIX SEPARATORS ARE THE PROOF.
# A seven-column row has exactly six of them, and then the two readings of the
# row — count six from the left, take the last cell from the right — are the
# same text. A row with MORE has a ` | ` inside one of its cells, and nothing
# here can tell WHICH cell it is in: the two readings disagree, and one of them
# writes the new state over the row's handoff path. So more than six is a
# REFUSAL naming the row, never a choice between them.
#
# MEASURED ON THE LIVE REGISTER, 2026-09-15 (1,335,595 bytes, 52 rows): 50 of
# them carry exactly six separators and split cleanly. `openXfactory-2` carries
# seven — one of them is inside its `objects owned` cell, so the two readings
# disagree about the HANDOFF PATH — and `openxfactory-4` eight, both inside its
# state cell. Those two are refused by name, and the fix is a person's: escape
# the pipe as `\|`, which is how a Markdown table carries a literal one, in a
# hand edit wrapped by `lanes-edit.sh commit`. A BARE `|` THAT IS NOT SPELLED
# ` | ` IS HARMLESS and stays inside whichever cell holds it: the state cells of
# `openRepoProject-1` and `openRepoTools-3` carry nineteen and four of them
# (`'| true'`, a quoted shell fragment), and both of those rows split exactly.
#
# It splits from the LEFT for the reason `row_split_session_cell` does — the
# cells that may carry a stray separator are the free-text ones at the end — and
# the three pieces are asserted to reassemble into the row before anything is
# written.

# ------------------------------------------- AMENDMENT 8, ruling (h): THE
# WRITER NEVER BLOCKS THE ESTATE.
#
# On 2026-09-12 at about 01:44Z an ssh `git-receive-pack` hung for five minutes
# AFTER its push had already landed, and `lanes-edit.sh append-row-status` sat
# inside it holding the mutex for the whole five minutes. Every lane on Eagle
# that wanted to write a row waited behind a lock whose holder was blocked on a
# socket, and the estate only moved again when the ssh was killed by hand.
#
# So every git call that touches the NETWORK — push, pull, fetch, ls-remote —
# runs under a timeout, and a timeout is not a failure to retry: it is a
# refusal to hold the mutex any longer. The helper aborts any rebase it started,
# releases the lock, prints how to find out whether the push landed anyway, and
# exits 3 with the edit safe in a local commit.
#
# `LANES_GIT_TIMEOUT` is the budget in seconds (default 60; 0 disables the
# bound). `LANES_GIT` is the binary, so a test can hand these calls — and ONLY
# these calls — a git that hangs, without shadowing git for the rest of the

# commit_push "<subject>" [<pathspec>...] — the pathspecs default to the
# register alone, which is every caller that predates Amendment 7. A LANDING
# or LANDED writes TWO (the register and the lane's log) so that both halves
# of one act land in one commit and no reader ever sees half of it.
# AMENDMENT 15 — A CASE-ONLY RENAME IS STAGED IN THE INDEX AND COMMITTED FROM
# IT, because a PATH-LIMITED commit cannot record one at all on a
# case-INSENSITIVE filesystem — which is what this repository's macOS job runs
# on. `ensure_log` renames a lane's log to the register row's spelling and
# hands the OLD path in beside the new one. Three things are true there, and
# together they leave exactly one way through:
#
#   * `git add -- <old> <new>` under git's own `core.ignorecase=true` matches
#     both pathspecs to the ONE index entry and stages a MODIFICATION under the
#     old name, so the rename never reaches the commit. Measured on the macOS
#     job of openRepoTools#41 at `48f2111`: fifteen red assertions, the first
#     of them *"the rename landed in the WRITE's own commit"*, whose
#     `git log -- <the canonical path>` came back EMPTY.
#   * The same `add` under `core.ignorecase=false` is no better, and is worse:
#     the OPERATING SYSTEM still resolves `lanes/log/repocase-1.md` to the file
#     now named `repoCase-1.md`, so git stages the old entry as MODIFIED and
#     the new path as a SECOND entry. One file on disk, two paths in the tree —
#     and every checkout after it reports the one it cannot materialise as
#     deleted, so the writes behind it are refused (2) for a dirty checkout
#     they did not make. Measured at `e35f2a8` and `928908a`: eleven red
#     assertions, all of them behind `lanes/log/repocase-1.md` reported dirty.
#   * `git commit -- <paths>` is `--only`: it builds the tree from HEAD and the
#     WORKING TREE of those paths, disregarding what is staged. So an index
#     that holds the rename exactly is thrown away by the commit anyway, and
#     the old path — which the OS still resolves — comes back in the tree.
#
# So the old entry is dropped from the INDEX by its exact path, where no
# filesystem is consulted at all; the NEW path alone is added; and the commit
# is made from the index rather than from a pathspec.
# `update-index --force-remove` is the one git verb that removes an entry
# without asking the filesystem whether the file is still there, and it is a
# no-op on a path the index does not hold — so a log that was never committed
# renames just as quietly. The index commit is FAIL-CLOSED: anything staged
# that is not one of this write's own pathspecs refuses (6) instead of riding
# along, which is the guarantee the `--only` pathspec was there to give.
#
# `-c core.ignorecase=false` stays on every call that takes `CP_PATHS`, because
# a pathspec that means one thing to `add` and another to `diff` is the same
# defect one line along: with the old entry already gone it is what makes `add`
# record the new path in the spelling the code computed rather than the one the
# index used to hold. It narrows nothing else — these paths are this file's own,
# `lanes/LANES.md` and `lanes/log/<lane>.md`, spelled by the code that computes

# much of the day — the register takes ~500 commits a day and a half-written
# row is what one of them looks like a second before it lands — so refusing
# every `claim`, `log` and `release` on it would push lanes to stop using the
# tool, and the pre-existing capture already exists precisely to make that
# state safe to rebase over. So: capture FIRST, exactly as every register
# write has done since --no-sweep (the warning included), and let the guard
# re-test the checkout afterwards.
#
# Only when the register is NOT one of this write's own pathspecs: a LANDING
# or a LANDED commits it itself, and the ordinary handle_preexisting call
# covers it there, --sweep included. There is nothing to sweep a register edit
# INTO when this commit does not touch the register, so this capture is always
# its own commit whatever --sweep says.
#
# It is reached only AFTER write_event's first guard, so it never commits on
# behalf of a write that is about to refuse: a checkout dirty in anything ELSE
# is refused before the lock and before this runs, and a refusal that had

# ======================================================== Amendment 7 ======
#
# THE PER-LANE OBJECT LOG.
#
#   lanes/log/<lane>.md — one file per lane, append-only, line 1 a header,
#   every other line an EVENT. This helper is the only writer, for the same
#   reason it is the register's only writer. One file per lane is also what
#   makes two workstations safe: two lanes writing at once touch two files.
#
#   <VERB> — lane <lane>, session <uuid>@<ws>, <UTC>, <object>[ → <payload>][ — <free text>]
#
#   The verb is ONE token. The first four fields are separated by `, `. The
#   OBJECT token contains no space and no comma; everything after it up to
#   ` — ` is payload, whose sub-fields are separated by `; ` and whose refs
#   are space-separated.
#
#   STATE IS PER LANE. A lane's state on an object is that lane's LAST line
#   naming it — the last such line IN THE FILE, never the largest UTC (R14);
#   the lane HOLDS the object when that verb is in the OPEN set; the object is
#   HELD when any lane holds it. There is no index file: a read fetches and
#   greps, because 45 lanes' logs together are smaller than one of the
#   register's rows.
#
#   LANES.md is unchanged. Its rows stay its rows and its Rule 6 LANDING /
#   LANDED lines stay where every lane already reads them as the merge hold —
#   which is why `who --landing` reads THOSE and not the logs. A LANDING or
#   LANDED writes both files in one commit, with two pathspecs.

# ONE LINE OUT OF A TABLE THIS SHELL IS ALREADY HOLDING, WITHOUT A PROCESS.
# The listing's three tables — the published register's index, this checkout's,
# and one line of facts per lane — are a few dozen lines each and were read with
# `printf | awk` PER LANE, which is six processes a lane to look up strings that
# are already in memory. Fenced with `$GS` and keyed on the lane name
# lower-cased, the whole lookup is one parameter expansion.
#
# IT ASSIGNS A GLOBAL AND RETURNS, rather than printing: a function whose answer
# is taken with `$( … )` forks, which is the cost this exists to avoid.
#
# AND THE EXPANSION IS `%%key*`, NEVER `#*key` — THE SAME FIRST MATCH, IN
# LINEAR TIME (opensoft/openRepoTools#107). Bash removes a shortest prefix by
# trying the whole pattern against EVERY prefix of the string in turn, and a
# pattern that opens with `*` costs a scan of that prefix each time: `#*key` is
# QUADRATIC in the table. A longest suffix is found by trying the pattern only
# where its FIRST character matches, and here that is `$GS`, which occurs once
# per line — so `%%key*` touches each byte about once. Both name the FIRST
# occurrence of `$GS<lane>$US`: `#*key` is everything up to and including it,
# `%%key*` everything before it. Measured on the suite's own fixture register
# (194 rows, 162 object logs): the per-lane loop of one `lanes --prefix` read
# was 56.6 s of its 58.1 s, about 75 ms per lookup, three or more lookups per
# lane — which is what put `lane`'s pick past the pty driver's 60-second bound.
# The offset is in CHARACTERS on both sides of the `+` (`${#…}` and `${1:…}`
# count the same way in any one locale), so a multibyte table cuts where the
# old expansion cut.

# TRANSITION OF ANYTHING. So they are their own set rather than members of
# `is_lane_verb`: every reader that computes a lane's state by the per-lane
# last-line rule takes the five lane verbs by name, and a sixth and seventh
# inside that predicate would have made the narrative move the lane — a `NOTED`
# after a swap's `PAUSED` would have made a paused lane read as neither paused
# nor running, which is the one thing `swapped` and `restart` are built on.
# The one reader that took the LAST lane-kind line whatever it was is
# `swapped_candidates`, and it skips these by name for exactly that reason.
#
# AMENDMENT 16 PUTS `RENAMED` HERE, AND THE SET IS WHAT IT WAS RATHER THAN WHAT
# IT IS CALLED: a LANE-KIND LINE THAT IS NOT A TRANSITION. Clause (c) says the
# rename's line "changes no object's state, every last-line reader skips it",
# which is Amendment 13(b)'s sentence about its own two in different words — and
# `swapped_candidates` is the proof that `is_lane_verb` is the wrong home: it
# takes a lane's last lane-kind line WHATEVER its verb is, so a `RENAMED` there
# would make a swapped lane read as neither paused nor running and `restart`
# would not find it. One predicate, three verbs, one property.
#
# `HANDOFF-REQUESTED` IS INSIDE `is_lane_verb` AND THESE THREE ARE NOT, and the
# difference is the object rather than the state: that predicate's ONE caller is
# the `log` arm's check that a lane verb's object is `lane:<name>`, which the
# request needs and which Amendment 13 gives its two by their own arm, as
# Amendment 16 gives `RENAMED` by its. None of the four moves a lane, and none

# AMENDMENT 15 — THE LOG FILE IS `lanes/log/<canonical>.md`, AND A FILE OF
# ANOTHER CASE IS STILL THIS LANE'S LOG.
#
# The log's file name was lowercased from the start, which is exactly why the
# 2026-09-13 incident produced TWO ROWS AND ONE LOG: `openXfactory-2` and
# `openxfactory-2` had always shared `lanes/log/openxfactory-2.md`. The real
# register still carries `lanes/log/openxfactory-4.md` beside the row
# `openxfactory-4` — the same spelling, nothing to do — and the historical
# mismatch is the shape these two functions exist for. READERS find the file
# whatever its case; the first WRITE renames it to the canonical spelling, once,
# inside its own commit (`ensure_log` below).
#
# `ls` and one `awk`, not a `$(lc …)` per file: `lanes/log/` carries a file per
# lane of the estate and this is asked on the path a person is waiting on.
#
# AND THE `--` STAYS (Copilot round 3 on openRepoTools#41, DECLINED with a
# measurement). It was read as a macOS defect — *"BSD `ls` rejects `--`, and the
# suppressed error makes every case-insensitive log scan empty"* — which would
# mean no first write ever renames anything on the one platform this amendment's
# rename exists for. BSD `ls` ends its options at `--` through `getopt(3)`, as
# every POSIX utility does, and `tests-macos` has been GREEN on the two
# assertions that can only pass if this scan finds a file of another case there:
# the rename recorded inside the write's own commit, and `lane-start`'s own
# `repo repocase → repoCase` out of the twin scan at `lane-start:677`. The suite
# asserts the parse itself as well, on every platform. Dropping `--` would hand
# a directory whose name begins with `-` back to `ls` as flags and change

# The PUBLISHED path of a lane's log, found the same way — the canonical path
# where `origin/<branch>` has no file of another case, so a lane with no log at
# all still reads as the pre-cutover 8 rather than as a failure.
#
# TWO PATHS DIFFERING ONLY BY CASE ARE A REFUSAL AND NOT A CHOICE (Copilot round
# 4 on openRepoTools#41). The `exit` after the first match read a tree holding
# BOTH `lanes/log/repocase-1.md` and `lanes/log/repoCase-1.md` as though it held
# one, and every reader behind it — `lane_log_events`, `lane_log_exists`,
# `last-session`, the listing's per-lane facts — then consumed whichever `ls-tree`
# happened to name first and DROPPED the other file's lines without saying so.
# That is two logs for one lane, the state 15(d)'s hand merge exists for, and an
# append-only history half of which is invisible is worse than a refusal. Counted
# and REFUSED (2) naming both, in `canon_lane`'s own shape — it RETURNS rather
# than exits, because every caller takes it with `$( )`.
#
# AND THE WORKING TREE ANSWERS WHERE `origin` HAS NOTHING. The fallback was the
# canonical path outright, which is a path that need not exist: a lane whose log

# this named another. `claim`'s dirty-checkout exemption is computed from it, so

# ------------------------------------------------------- reading the logs
#
# One parser, used by everything. It prints US-separated fields, UTC first:
#   utc  lane  verb  uuid  ws  object  ref  payload  text  file  line
#
# The last two are the line's ADDRESS — the file it was read from and its
# number IN THAT FILE (FNR, so it is the number the reader sees in the log and
# the number an `unreadable:` report names). That address is what every state
# read orders by (R14): the log is append-only, so a line further down the file
# is a line written later, whatever the two lines' UTC fields say.
# `match()` is used for every multi-byte separator: RSTART and RLENGTH are in
# the same units as each other whatever the locale, and a hard-coded byte
# offset for " — " is not.
# AMENDMENT 16(e) — A LINE'S LANE IS THE LANE OF THE FILE IT IS IN, and that is
# the whole of the rule.
#
# Clause (c) is explicit that a rename rewrites none of the lines above it:
# *"the lines above it — which still say `lane <old>` — are never rewritten"*.
# So after a rename a lane's log holds its whole history under two names, in one
# file, about one lane — the exact shape Amendment 15 met when one lane's log
# spelled it two ways, and the exact failure: `lane_objects`, `superseded_by`,
# `holders_of`, `lane_row_facts` and `first_landed_of` all key on this field, so
# read byte for byte HALF A RENAMED LANE'S HOLDS BECOME INVISIBLE — `who --lane`
# calls a held object free and `lane-end` ends a lane that holds one.
#
# THE FIRST ANSWER WAS AN ALIAS LOOKUP IN THIS PARSE, AND IT WAS THE WRONG ONE
# (Copilot round 1 on openRepoTools#81). A rename FREES the old name — no row
# carries it, so `lane_next_free` hands the position out and a NEW lane can be
# called it — and from that moment the field `lane <old>` is ambiguous: it is
# the renamed lane's history in one file and the new lane's present in another.
# No amount of resolving a NAME tells those apart, because the name is the same.
#
# THE FILE DOES. Amendment 7's first sentence is one file per lane, single
# writer, and Amendment 15 makes its name the row's own spelling — so
# `lanes/log/<lane>.md` IS the statement of which lane every line in it belongs
# to, it MOVES with the rename (clause (c)), and it needs no table to read. The
# field stays on the line as the spelling somebody typed; the FILE is what the
# readers are keyed on. That also settles, with nothing added, the two spellings
# of one lane Amendment 15 had to reason about line by line.

# The register, read the same way — `who --landing` is a state read about a
# merge hold other lanes are holding their merges for, so it must see what
# landed rather than what this checkout happens to have pulled.
# CACHED FOR THE LIFE OF ONE PROCESS, and Amendment 11's listing is the reason.
# The published register is a 1 MB file and this is a `git show` of it; every
# `row_of_lane`, `lane_named_ci`, `lane_of_session` and `lane_workstation` call
# makes one. A single lane's act makes a handful and nobody noticed — but
# `lanes` asks about EVERY lane in the register, so the same megabyte was being
# re-rendered dozens of times for one listing a person is waiting on.
#
# IT IS SAFE BECAUSE NOTHING INSIDE ONE INVOCATION MOVES IT. `origin/<branch>`
# is advanced by `log_sync`, which every subcommand runs BEFORE it reads, and by
# `commit_push`, which runs AFTER the last read of a write path — so the ref a
# process reads is fixed for as long as that process reads it. The one act that
# would break that assumption is a second `log_sync` mid-read, and there is
# none; `log_sync` clears this cache anyway, so a caller that adds one gets the
# fresh answer rather than a stale one.
# AND IN A FILE AS WELL AS A VARIABLE (A11 Addendum 4 ruling 12). The variable
# serves one shell; every caller of `row_of_lane`, `lane_workstation` and
# `session_ids_of_lane` reaches it through `$( … )`, which is a SUBSHELL, so the
# variable cache was rebuilt — a `git show` of 1.1 MB — by all four of the
# per-lane reads the listing makes, for every lane. The file survives the
# subshell that wrote it, so the megabyte is rendered once per process.

# ------------------------------------------- issue #30: A DEAD LANE'S HOLD
#
# `claim_is_stale` answers Rule 1's own question — is THIS CLAIM old — and on
# purpose it refuses for anything that is not a CLAIMED issue: Rule 6 governs a
# PR's own thirty minutes, and an OPENED, LANDING or WITHDRAWN was never a
# claim to begin with. Neither test answers a DIFFERENT question Rule 1 never
# had a word for: the LANE holding the object is not coming back at all,
# whatever verb its last line on the object used. Measured 2026-09-13
# (opensoft/openRepoTools#30): lane openRepoProject-1 went silent and was
# retired (`lane-end --retire`, Amendment 6(d)), leaving an OPENED PR and two
# CLAIMED issues behind — `claim --force` refused all three, the verb-check
# refusing the PR and the four-hour clock refusing the issues (a CLAIMED lane
# that later OPENED a PR naming it is deliberately never stale by Rule 1's own
# test, which is exactly backwards for a lane that is dead). The workaround
# was a `release` on the dead lane's behalf, by hand, object by object.
#
# DEAD, HERE, MEANS THE REGISTER SAYS SO, FIRST: the holder's own object log's
# last LANE-KIND line (Amendment 7(b)'s STARTED/PAUSED/RESUMED/ENDED/RETIRED —
# `lane_row_facts`' own "last lane-kind line wins in file order" rule, R14,
# read for one lane rather than for a whole listing) is ENDED or RETIRED.
# PAUSED IS DELIBERATELY NOT DEAD — a swap is a planned, expected stop
# (Amendment 8) and stealing a swapped lane's claims would be exactly the
# collision this protocol exists to prevent — and neither is a log with no
# lane-kind line yet, which cannot hold an object through this path at all
# (`state_events` reads nothing for it either).
#
# AND CONFIRMED, NEVER ASSUMED, SECOND: a register that says RETIRED is not
# proof by itself that nothing is still running under that name — Amendment
# 6(d)'s retire act writes no signal and kills no process, and
# opensoft/openRepoTools#39 is exactly a register saying one thing while a
# duplicate process says another. So the verdict is checked against
# `live_holder` — the ONE liveness implementation this file has, over the same
# published-union-local id set `lanes-edit.sh live-holder` already builds, and
# never a new one — and a lane a live record on THIS workstation still holds is
# refused exactly as an untaken CLAIMED is: "refuse where the holder is live"
# is not a special case here, it is this same rule. A `live_holder` read that
# FAILS is not "confirmed live" (fail closed for the log half, as every other
# reader of this stream does) — but nor is it "confirmed dead": a RETIRED
# verdict this workstation simply cannot check against any records at all is
# HELD BACK exactly as a live one is, because issue #30's fix must never be
# LESS safe than the check it sits beside. STALE UNTIL PR #61 (Copilot round
# 11): this paragraph used to say such a read "is not held back either",
# which described the opposite of the fail-closed rule the code below it
# already enforced — only an ACTUAL, CONFIRMED-EMPTY read (`live_holder` exit
# 8, never a bare rc 0 check) allows the takeover that every other outcome,
# read failures included, withholds.
#
# 0 dead-and-confirmed (`HOLDER_DEAD_VERB` names the verdict), 1 not — refuse
# as before. (This is `holder_is_dead`'s OWN return code, a different space
# from the three `live_holder` answers just above it.)
#
# A LINE WHOSE PAYLOAD OPENS `fork ` IS NEVER THE LANE'S OWN VERB (Copilot
# round 8, PR #61) — the same exclusion `lane_row_facts` already makes (above,
# "A FORK-S RETIRED IS NOT THE LANE-S OWN LAST VERB") and for the identical
# reason: the first build of ruling 8's retire act appended `RETIRED … lane:
# <lane> -> fork <sid>; pid <n>; kind <k>` to the LANE's own log for a FORK it
# retired, and nothing writes one any more but these logs are append-only, so
# one written under that build is still there. Read as this lane's own last
# line, it says the LANE was retired — backwards for a lane that may be alive
# beside the fork it disowned, and exactly the state a PAUSED (swapped) lane
# would be in if a stray line like this landed after its own last STARTED or
# RESUMED: `claim --force` would read it as ENDED and take over holds a
# planned, expected stop was never meant to surrender — the very collision
# Amendment 8 exists to prevent.
#
# A LOG THAT YIELDED NO LANE-KIND VERDICT AT ALL IS ITS OWN ANSWER TOO
# (Copilot on 05d7889, PR #61). The read used to be one pipeline whose status
# was `awk`'s, so a log `lane_log_events` could not read — two files differing
# only by case on origin, a `git show` that failed, a log no longer there —
# came back as an EMPTY verdict with status 0 and set neither marker below:
# `claim_rescan_hook` then told the operator the log had "moved past the
# terminal line", which nobody had read. `HOLDER_NO_VERDICT` is that case,
# named: the read failed, or it produced no STARTED/PAUSED/RESUMED/ENDED/
# RETIRED line to judge. It is still `return 1` — fail closed — and only the
# words a caller prints change.
#
# AND THE CONFIRMATION IS PRONOUNCED ONLY FROM INSIDE THE LANE'S LAST BINDING
# (Copilot on 8ce6c9d, PR #61, against Amendment 18(b) as #83 landed it):
# *"Liveness is pronounced only from INSIDE the binding's own `host` and
# `container`, where the pid namespace is the record's: from anywhere else a
# binding is UNKNOWN, never dead."* `live_holder` answering 8 says no session
# record on THIS workstation holds the lane — which proves nothing about a lane
# whose last `STARTED`/`RESUMED` was written on another host or in another
# container, so a terminal log there plus an empty read here would have handed
# its open holds to `--force` on a fact nobody could establish. The binding is
# read off the last such line before the terminal one, with clause (a)'s
# cutover rule (no `host`/`container`/`os` at all is a line from before it,
# matched on the line's own workstation), and judged by `binding_is_here` —
# the one locality rule this file has. Not here, the one exception clause (b)
# carves out still applies: a shared tmux server on which the binding's window
# is GONE is a dead binding (`binding_window_state`) — and then the local
# `live_holder` read below still has to come back empty, because a dead pane
# is not proof that nothing on this workstation still carries the lane
# (Copilot on a52abc6). Anything else is
# `HOLDER_BOUND_ELSEWHERE` (the binding's `host/container`), and refused like
# every other verdict this workstation could not establish. A log with no
# binding line at all keeps the local read, which is all there is to ask.

# WHERE THE TIME WENT, measured on a copy of the live register (46 rows, 15
# logs) before any of this was written: `lanes` took 14 m 30 s wall and ~23
# CPU-minutes. Not the register, and not the logs — a `git show` of the 1.1 MB
# register is 11 ms and the fifteen logs are one cached pass. It was THIS: 564
# session records on this workstation, each read with `cat` and then four or
# five `jstr`/`jnum` calls that are FOUR PROCESSES EACH (`printf | grep | head |
# sed`) — about twenty processes per record, eleven thousand per scan — and both
# scans were rebuilt FOR EVERY LANE, because `live_session_ids` and `fork_map`
# cached into a VARIABLE and every caller invoked them inside `$( … )`, which is
# a subshell whose variables die with it.

# FILES, which a subshell's build leaves behind for its parent.

# is exact: `jstr` is the first `"key":"…"` whose value holds no `"`, `jnum` the
# first `"key":` followed immediately by a digit. Both are `grep -o … | head -n1`
# on the whole blob, so both take the FIRST occurrence and neither is anchored.

# ------------------------------------- AMENDMENT 8, ruling (g): WHOSE session
#
# Three facts about this estate's records, every one of them observed on
# 2026-09-12 while `lane-start` was refusing the very window that held the lane:
#
#   1. THE HARNESS EXPORTS `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` into every shell a session
#      runs — so a `lane-start` that a session runs already knows its own
#      transcript id without asking the filesystem anything. That is the
#      cheapest and the most certain test there is, and it comes first.
#   2. ONE SESSION WRITES MORE THAN ONE RECORD. Beside the interactive process
#      in the pane the harness runs a companion: `kind: bg`, no `tmux`, no
#      `nameSource`, its own pid, and THE SAME `sessionId`. Records that share a
#      `sessionId` are one session, not a queue of rival holders, and there is
#      no contest between them to win.
#   3. A RECORD MAY CARRY NO `tmux` AT ALL. The pane's interactive record
#      usually has one, the companion never does, and the harness has been seen
#      to write none for a process plainly in a window. "No target" is not "no
#      window": it is a missing observation, and the process tree holds the
#      answer the record failed to write down.
#
# What those three produced: `live_holder` returned the COMPANION — its
# `sessionId` matched the row, its pid was alive, and carrying no `nameSource`
# it survived the name test — reported its target as `none`, and `lane-start`
# read "not this window" and refused the session that was running the command:
#
#   lane openRepoProject-1 is live in session c5701b54… (tmux none);
#   take openRepoProject-2 or resume that window
#
# The orphaned idle holder from the PREVIOUS profile was a real find and was
# correctly retired under Amendment 6(d); this one was the same shape read
# wrongly. The difference between them is not recency and never was — it is
# whether the process is in THIS pane's tree.

# A `kind: bg` record is a COMPANION: never a holder, never a rival, skipped by
# every read that asks who holds a lane or what is in a window. Only
# `interactive` records hold a lane; a record from a harness too old to say
# carries no `kind` at all and is read as interactive, because that is the only
# thing those harnesses ever wrote.

# R22 — IT FAILS CLOSED AT THE SOURCE. Three answers, and they are distinct:
#   0  a live record holds the lane (the row is printed)
#   8  the records were READ, and none of them does
#   1  the records could not be read — a permissions or IO fault
#
# AND ON 0 IT SAYS WHOSE (Amendment 8, ruling (g)). The fifth field is the
# verdict — `here`, `elsewhere` or `orphan` — because the caller that has to act
# on it cannot work it out from the `tmux` column: a record with no target is
# not a record in no window, and `lane-start` refusing on that string is what
# refused this lane its own window. `here` beats `elsewhere` beats `orphan`, and
# a record with no target whose SESSION also wrote a windowed record is that
# same session seen twice, not a second holder — it is dropped, never ranked.
# `lane-start` renames a window on 8 and REFUSES on anything else, so collapsing
# a failed read into 8 is exactly how a running lane loses its address: the
# rename mints `<lane> (2)` (AGENTS.md rule 7). The first version returned 1 for
# both, which is the same fault one layer up; hardening the CALLER left this

# -------------------------------- AMENDMENT 8(f), R-A8-6: the ORPHANED HOLDERS
#
# A row's session cell is a HISTORY, and its EARLIER ids are history rather than
# alternatives — but a live process can still be holding one, which is Amendment
# 6(d)'s orphan and, on this lane, the reason the `/resume` picker offered two
# transcripts of which neither was the lane. `live_holder` answers about the
# lane's holder, one record, picked; this answers about ALL the earlier ids, and
# it answers to be READ.
#
# IT NAMES THEM AND DOES NOTHING ELSE. Retiring is `kill <pid>`, printed by the
# caller and run by a person: ending somebody's process is not a boundary
# script's act — an idle background session is exactly the shape of thing that
# turns out to be somebody's long-running job — and clause (f) rules it the
# operator's, for the same reason clause (a)'s step 3 pushes nobody's work for
# them.
#
# IDLE means a LIVE record (Amendment 6's three tests: a status that is not
# ended, a pid that is alive, a `procStart` that still matches) which is NOT a
# session in a window: a `kind: bg` companion, or a record carrying no `tmux`
# target at all. A live INTERACTIVE record with a window is not an orphan, it is
# a rival, and `live_holder` is the read that answers about those.

# uuid without anybody acting — a `/clear` does it (Amendment 6, fact 4), and so
# did the 2026-09-12 usage reset that carried this lane's conversation into
# `4a91f1dc…` while its row still ended on `09dd34d1…`. That id is in no row, so
# `live_holder` cannot see it and answers 8, "this lane is parked", about the
# conversation sitting in the window it was asked about. Keyed on the WINDOW
# instead, the record is found, and `lane-start` appends its uuid to the cell
# before it stamps — which is what makes the next resume land in the right
# conversation.

# record's `tmux` field carries before its `.%<pane>` suffix.
#
# NO NAME TEST. `live_holder`'s fifth test skips a record explicitly named for
# another lane, because there the question is "does this record hold that lane".
# Here the question is "what is running in this window", and a window holds one
# interactive session whatever it is called: the record's name is REPORTED, so
# the caller can put it in front of a person, and decides nothing.
#
# R22 — three answers, never two of them conflated: 0 with the record, 8 when
# the records were READ and none is in that window, 1 when they could not be
# read at all.
# WHERE SEVERAL LIVE RECORDS NAME ONE WINDOW, IDENTITY DECIDES — NOT RECENCY
# (Amendment 8, ruling (g); this replaces the first version's "the most recently
# updated one wins", which was wrong in the case it was written for).
#
#   tier 3  its `sessionId` is `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, which the harness
#           exported into this very shell — when the window asked about is this
#           one. Nothing beats a session naming itself.
#   tier 2  its pid is this pane's process or below it — again only for this
#           window. This is what lets a record with NO `tmux` be found: the
#           harness does not always write the target down, and a record without
#           one is not thereby in no window.
#   tier 1  its `tmux` field names the window. The fast path, and the only test
#           available for a window that is not this one.
#
# `updatedAt` breaks a tie WITHIN a tier and nowhere else, so the answer never
# depends on directory order. It cannot be the rule itself: it is a LIVENESS
# HEARTBEAT, and the idle companion beside a working session heartbeats later
# than the session does — in the 2026-09-12 records the companion's `updatedAt`
# was 1789235975177 against the interactive record's 1789235958137, so "the
# newest wins" picks precisely the record that is not in the window. Two records
# of ONE session are not a contest to win at all: the windowed one represents
# the session, and `record_is_session` has already dropped the companion.

# (the row itself, its session cell, its handoff path and its workstation
# column) were the last ones taking the WORKING TREE, and `print_holder_detail`
# is built entirely out of them — so `who` routinely answered with a current log
# and a stale row: a holder recorded on the other workstation read `NOT LIVE`
# because a peer's UNCOMMITTED edit to column 3 said `Eagle`, and a row that
# exists only on `origin/main` was not seen at all, losing the resume uuid and
# the handoff path, which are the two things `who` exists to hand over. Nothing
# in `who` reads the working tree now.

# AMENDMENT 15 — `tolower` ON BOTH SIDES, like every other lookup of a lane
# name in this file. A caller reaches these two through `canon_lane`, so the
# name arriving here is already the ROW's own spelling; the comparison is
# case-insensitive anyway, because a caller that did not canonicalise must not
# silently read "this lane has no row" about a lane that has one.

#
# THE RESOLVER. **A lane name is compared CASE-INSENSITIVELY wherever a name is
# looked up, and the spelling the register row carries is canonical** — it is

# called, and what every line and stamp writes. A name typed in another case
# RESOLVES to it and is never written as typed.
#
# Every spelling the PUBLISHED register carries for a name, from
# `origin/<branch>` like every other state read (R19). `lane_named_ci` below is
# the same question asked for one answer and no refusal — it is the hook's read
# and the hook never refuses — so the two are one parse in two shapes rather
# than two rules.
#
# AND A THIRD SHAPE SINCE AMENDMENT 12: the prompt guard asks this one because
# it COUNTS. `canon_lane` below answers a caller that wants a name back and
# refuses two with `note` + 2 in this file's own voice; the guard has to print
# its triple FIRST and then say what is wrong, in its own shape, so it takes the
# spellings from here and makes the refusal itself. One parse, three readings,

# `lane="$(canon_lane "$lane")" || exit 2`, and `lane-start`, `lane-end`, `lane`
# and `lane-handoff` each call the `canon-lane` subcommand — so the resolution

# one layer down. A list of readers is a list somebody has to keep complete.
#
# READ FROM `origin/<branch>` LIKE THE REGISTER (R19), falling back to this
# checkout's own file — `register_text`'s exact shape, for its exact reason:
# `rename-lane` lands the row and this table in ONE commit, so a reader taking

# `lane="$(canon_lane "$lane")" || exit 2`.
#
# THE REFUSAL IS THE AMENDMENT'S OWN AND IT BELONGS TO EVERY WRITER, not only
# to `lane-start`, which has refused two rows for one name since Amendment 5:
# clause (b) says *"where the register already holds two rows that differ only
# by case, every writer REFUSES, naming both, until they are merged"*. Merging
# them is 15(d)'s act and a person's — the newer row's session id(s) appended to
# the older row's cell, in order, and the newer row removed in the same commit —
# because a tool that merged two rows of history on its own would be choosing
# which lane's record survives.
#
# AMENDMENT 16(e) — AND A NAME WITH NO ROW IS ASKED OF THE ALIAS TABLE BEFORE
# the typed spelling is handed back. This is clause (e)'s whole implementation
# and it is one function deep: a renamed lane's OLD name, from a line, a window,
# a session record or a person's typing, lands on the row it is now. The order
# is row first and alias second — a name that is a lane today is that lane — and
# the resolution SAYS SO on stderr, because every act under an old name is an
# act on a lane the caller did not name.

# PAIRING is by (lane, PR) — the LANDED closes the most recent LANDING of that
# lane and PR that is still unmatched, and the pair’s repository is the
# LANDING’s — while the RESULT still keys on (lane, repository, PR), which is
# what keeps a LANDED on one repository from closing a LANDING on another.
# AND A LANDED THAT NAMES A REPOSITORY PREFERS A LANDING ON THAT REPOSITORY
# (R24, Addendum 6). Only a LANDED with NO `into <repo> main` clause takes the
# most recent unmatched LANDING regardless — it has said nothing about where it
# landed, so the LANDING is the only thing that can say. One that DOES name a
# repository takes the most recent unmatched LANDING naming the same one, and
# is reported as an `unpaired LANDED` — closing nothing — only when there is no
# such LANDING at all. Without the preference, a lane with two LANDINGs open on
# ONE PR number in two repositories that lands the EARLIER one, naming its
# repository, was unpaired and both holds stayed open until the second landed.
# The answer is identical everywhere else, including the (lane, repository, PR)
# result key: a LANDED on one repository still closes no LANDING on another.
#
# The repository is lower-cased IN THE KEY ONLY: the register spells one
# repository four ways in a week, and a LANDED spelled `OpsxFactory` must still
# close a LANDING spelled `opsXfactory`.
#
# AND BOTH SIDES GO THROUGH `lanes/repos.tsv` FIRST (R29, Addendum 7). Case is
# only half of it: the register writes `OpsxFactory` and `opensoft/OpsxFactory`
# for ONE repository — 23 Rule 6 lines against 70 at `8f9c04d` — and
# `codexFactory`, `codeXfactory/codexFactory` and `opensoft/codexFactory` for
# another. Compared literally, a LANDED spelled one way does not close the
# LANDING spelled the other: it reads as an `unpaired LANDED`, the hold stays
# open, and over-reporting a merge hold is the direction that stalls other
# lanes' merges. So every `into <repo> main` is resolved AS IT IS PARSED, which
# makes the pairing, R24's preference and the (lane, repository, PR) result key
# agree by construction — the key's repository is the canonical spelling, and
# an alias the table does not know keeps its own, case-blind like every other.
#
# WHAT THAT IS WORTH TODAY, measured read-only over `origin/main` at `6fa966b`:
# the VERDICT does not move — 1 open LANDING (lane browser-ui-repair's PR #401,
# genuinely in flight) and 0 unpaired LANDED, before this change and after it.
# No (lane, PR) pair in the register mixes its spellings YET, so this is a
# guard and not a repair, and it is worth saying so rather than claiming a hold
# it did not clear. What it does move there is the KEY: 17 result-key spellings
# collapse to the 11 repositories they name, and two LANDINGs a retry spelled
# two ways are one hold instead of two.
#
# The table is handed in through the ENVIRONMENT, as `LANES_RULE6_ALIASES`,
# one `<lowercased alias>\037<owner/repo>` per line — because awk cannot read
# `repos.tsv` for itself here (this program's stdin is the register) and
# because `awk -v`, which is where it used to go, carries ONE LINE: see
# `who_landing` for what a many-line `-v` does on macOS's awk.
#
# BOTH LAYERS, SHIPPED FIRST (Amendment 9(b)). This is the second reader of the
# table — `alias_lookup` is the other — and it layers them the same way by
# reading the shipped file before the override, so the LAST assignment to an
# alias wins and an override row REPLACES the shipped row for that alias while
# adding rows the shipped table does not carry. One map, emitted in the order
# the aliases were first seen, so the output is stable.

# ======================================================== Amendment 8 ======
#
# SWAP AND RESTART, THE READ SIDE.
#
#   A SWAP is a planned stop — a usage reset, a profile switch — and a RESTART
#   is the launch that follows it. Neither adds a file. The RECORD a swap
#   leaves is the lane's own PAUSED line, payload
#   `swap; window <tmux session>:<index>; workstation <ws>`, and a lane is
#   SWAPPED on a workstation when that PAUSED is its LAST lane-kind line.
#
#   Both reads here are READ-ONLY and neither ever writes. `swapped` is what a
#   launcher asks when the tmux window name is gone — a restart opens a NEW
#   tmux session, which is precisely why the window name cannot carry the lane
#   across one. `session-start` is the SessionStart hook's whole output.

# The register's own spelling of a lane whose name matches $1 ignoring case,
# read from `origin/<branch>` like every other state read (R19). Rule 10's wire
# form is lowercase and a tmux window may carry either, while the row's token is
# camel (`openRepoProject-1`): an exact lookup alone loses the lane.
#
# AMENDMENT 16(e) — AND IT RESOLVES A FORMER NAME, through the same seat every
# other reader takes. Clause (e) names the `SessionStart` block among the
# readers that resolve, and this is the read behind it: a window still carrying
# the name a lane had before its rename would otherwise orient the new session
# to "no lane bound to this window" — which is the one thing that block exists
# not to say — while the lane's row, log and handoff are all a `lane-rename`
# away under another name.
#
# `rows_named_ci_alias` IS THAT SEAT AND THIS IS `head -n1` OF IT, which is
# exactly what the `exit` in the awk above was: one answer and no refusal. The
# hook never refuses, so where two rows differ only by case this still answers
# with the first of them and `canon_lane` — the read every WRITER goes through
# — is where that pair is refused.
#   0 + one spelling (or nothing) · 5 the alias table could not be READ
# The 5 is carried for `rows_named_ci_alias`-s reason: `session_start_block` is
# a hook and may not refuse, but it must not print "no lane bound to this
# window" about a window whose name it could not resolve.

# ============================================================================
# AMENDMENT 11 — THE RECORD'S SUB-FIELDS, AND THE READS BUILT ON THEM
# ============================================================================
#
# Amendment 11 clause (c) gives the lane's `STARTED`/`RESUMED` lines and the
# swap record two new payload sub-fields, `dir <path>` and `profile <name>`,
# beside Amendment 8(b)'s `window`, which gains a second ref. Clause (h) turns
# the reads of them into subcommands, for the reason Amendment 7(d) already
# gives `live-holder` and `lane-objects`: EACH READ EXISTS SO THAT SEVERAL
# CALLERS SHARE ONE IMPLEMENTATION. `window-lane` has three (the launcher's
# precedence 3, `/restart`'s step 2(c), the `/lane-swap` skill's step 1);
# `session-lane` has two (`/restart`'s step 2(b) and the SessionStart hook);
# `lane-dir` has four. A rule implemented once cannot be implemented three
# ways, which is exactly how the launcher, the skill and `/restart` would come
# to disagree about which lane a window is.

# ONE PARSER OF A PAYLOAD'S SUB-FIELDS, AND ONE UNQUOTER.
#
# Amendment 7(b)'s grammar: sub-fields are separated by `; `, and SEVERAL REFS
# INSIDE ONE SUB-FIELD ARE SEPARATED BY SPACES — which is what the `window`
# sub-field's `<session>:<index> <@id>` relies on. So an unquoted
# `dir $HOME/my projects/x` (unquoted) parses as two refs and hands back a truncated
# path, and clause (c)'s rule is that the WRITER QUOTES a value containing a
# space and EVERY READER takes a value opening with `"` as running to its
# closing `"`, stripping both.
#
# Two modes, because the grammar has two kinds of value:
#   (default)  ONE REF — the value up to its first space, or the whole of a
#              quoted value. `dir` and `profile` are read this way.
#   all        EVERY REF — the whole sub-field, which is what `window` is:
#              two refs that a caller splits itself.

# ---------------------------------------- AMENDMENT 17(b): THE TWO SUB-FIELDS
#
# `agent <name>` and `transcript <id|none>`, VALIDATED BY THE WRITER. Amendment
# 17(b) gives the `PAUSED` payload both; nothing else in this file could check
# them, because a payload is free text to `write_event` — and this log is
# APPEND-ONLY, so a sub-field written wrong is wrong for ever and no later line
# corrects it. The check is the same shape `valid_uuid` gives the session field
# under clause (e): the WRITER is the gate, from any caller.
#
# WHAT EACH ADMITS, and why the pattern is the rule rather than a list:
#   agent       A MANIFEST KEY — letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`. It is what
#               `lane-start --agent <name>` reads back to choose a launcher, so
#               a value carrying a space or a `;` is a value that would come
#               back as two sub-fields or as an argument nobody meant. The
#               pattern is also how this sub-field gets SPEC rev 6 §5's `; `
#               rule without a token of its own — the same argument clause (c)'s
#               `profile` takes.
#   transcript  THE AGENT'S OWN RESUMABLE ID, or the literal `none` — which is
#               an ANSWER ("this agent has no resumable id") and not a gap.
#               Claude's is a uuid; another agent's is whatever that agent
#               prints, so the shape is the same manifest key rather than
#               `valid_uuid`, which would refuse every agent but one.
#
# A PAYLOAD CARRYING NEITHER IS VALID AND STAYS VALID. Every record written
# before this amendment carries neither, and Amendment 7(i)'s cutover rule is
# that a reader finding none says so rather than assuming one. The check fires
# only on a sub-field that is THERE.
# THE TWO ARE WRITTEN TOGETHER OR NOT AT ALL, AND AN EMPTY ONE IS NOT AN
# ABSENT ONE (Copilot rounds 1 and 2 on openRepoTools#47). The first shape of
# this gate entered on either sub-field and then accepted each empty result
# independently, which let a HALF record through: `agent codex` with no
# transcript, or `transcript <id>` with no agent, both of which `lane-start`
# reads one field of and defaults the other — launching Claude on a codex id,
# or codex on none. And a sub-field written EMPTY (`; agent ; …`) parsed
# identically to one that was never there, so a malformed line was indexed as a
# pre-amendment one for ever, in a log nothing rewrites.
#
# PRESENCE IS READ OFF THE SUB-FIELDS, never off the whole line: `dir
# /srv/agent-work` carries the letters and is not the field.

# ------------------------- AMENDMENT 18(a): THE BINDING'S THREE SUB-FIELDS
#
# WRITTEN BY THE WRITER, ONCE, FOR EVERY CALLER — the argument this file already
# makes for putting the container refusal at the dispatcher: *"nine copies of one
# rule is how eight of them would come to disagree."* `lane-start` writes
# `STARTED`/`RESUMED`, `lane-handoff` writes `PAUSED`, and clause (e)'s forced
# `PAUSED` is written here; all three go through `write_event`, so the three
# facts are appended HERE and no boundary script carries a copy of the probe.
#
# THE THREE VERBS ARE CLAUSE (a)'s THREE, AND `ENDED`/`RETIRED` ARE NOT AMONG
# THEM. Clause (a) is the RULE and it names `STARTED`, `RESUMED` and `PAUSED`;
# clause (b) reads the binding out of `STARTED`/`RESUMED` alone and a `PAUSED`
# releases it. Amendment 18's Adoption list adds `lane-end`'s two "for the
# record", and they are left out deliberately: Amendment 7(b) says *"`PAUSED`,
# `RESUMED`, `ENDED` and `RETIRED` take no payload"*, Amendment 11 clause (c)
# narrows that for `RESUMED` as **edit 1 of six** and says in the same breath
# that *"`ENDED` and `RETIRED` stay payload-free"*, and `lane-end` already
# refuses to write one for exactly that reason (its own block argues it at
# length: a payload there is a SEVENTH edit to in-force text where the count is
# six and the six are ratified, `R-A11-15`). A verb that RELEASES a binding has
# no binding to describe, so nothing is lost by the omission and a ratified
# count is not quietly broken by it.
#
# APPENDED AND NEVER SUBSTITUTED: a payload that already carries one of the
# three is the caller's own and is left exactly as it is, so a test seam, a
# replay and a future writer that fills them in itself all keep their value.
# They go LAST, after Amendment 11(c)'s and Amendment 17(b)'s, on the same
# cutover argument those took: a reader written before this clause stops at the
# sub-field it knows, and one that finds none says so (Amendment 7(i)).
#
# A VALUE THAT WOULD MAKE THE LINE UNREADABLE COSTS ITS OWN SUB-FIELD AND NEVER
# THE LINE (`R-A11-11`'s posture): the drop is printed, and the binding still
# names whichever of the three it could write.

#
# TWO RUNGS, first answer wins:
#   1. the window's own NAME, where the register has a row for it. That is
#      clause (b)'s precedence 2 read through the same door, so a caller that
#      asks this read a ref gets the same answer the launcher would.
#   2. this workstation's swap records, matched on the ref.
#
# SCOPED TO THE ASKING WORKSTATION, IN THE CONTRACT AND NOT ONLY IN `Open`. A
# `<session>:<index>` is a local fact about one machine, and `claude-x:0`
# written on Raven collides with `claude-y:0` on Eagle far more easily than an
# `<@id>` will. `swapped` takes `[<ws>]` for exactly that reason and this read
# takes it for the same one: records written by another workstation are NOT
# CONSIDERED.
#
# THE AGREEMENT RULE, AND THIS READ OWNS IT. Existing-now is not enough on its
# own: a record naming `claude-y:0 @97`, met from the window that has since
# taken `claude-y:0` as `@200`, passes the existing-now test on its ref and
# would bind the lane to a stranger's pane with no question — which is the
# failure the liveness fence exists to stop, arriving through the LIVE ref
# instead of the dead one. So:
#
#   a record that carries an `<@id>` is matched on its `<session>:<index>` ONLY
#   WHERE THE WINDOW NOW HOLDING THAT REF REPORTS THAT SAME ID; a record with
#   no id is matched on the ref alone.

# ------------------------- decision 8(c) and 8(e): A FORK IS NEVER A HOLDER
#
# Evidence 6, 2026-09-13: an abandoned launch of a lane left behind a DAEMON
# FORK of its transcript — `--fork-session`, a NEW session id, `kind: bg`, no
# tmux, a cwd of `/workspace` — which went on orchestrating the same plan,
# relaunched writers on the same three branches, wrote `RESUMED` and `PAUSED`
# lines into the lane's log, and messaged the interactive session claiming to
# be the holder while citing a dead pid.
#
# Amendment 8 ruling (g) already skips a `kind: bg` companion, and that is not
# enough: a fork is a SESSION OF ITS OWN with an id no row carries, so the
# thing that makes it recognisable is neither its kind nor its id but ITS
# TRANSCRIPT'S TITLE. A `--fork-session` copies the parent's `custom-title`
# record, so the fork's transcript says `openRepoProject-1` while its id says
# something the lane's row has never heard of. That pair — THE LANE'S TITLE
# UNDER AN ID THE LANE DOES NOT RECORD — is the defect, and it is what this
# read finds.
#
# IT NAMES THEM AND DOES NOTHING ELSE, exactly as `idle_holders` does and for
# the same reason clause (f) of Amendment 8 gives. THE ACT IT NAMES IS
# `lane-end <lane> --retire <pid|uuid>` (clause (k) rule (e), A11 Addendum 4
# ruling 8) and never `kill <pid>`: that act is the DOOR to Amendment 6(d), it
# writes nothing and *"neither kills a process"*. So this read goes on naming a
# fork until 6(d) is actually taken on it — the retitle, or the process gone —
# which is what is TRUE; and stopping the process stays a person's act that no
# surface here prints as the one.
#
# One line per fork, `<session id><TAB><pid><TAB><kind><TAB><cwd>`.
# 0 with rows, 8 with none, 1 where the records could not be read.
# Every LIVE record on this workstation whose transcript carries a custom
# title, as
# `<lc title><US><title><US><sessionId><US><lc sessionId><US><pid><US><kind><US><cwd>`.
# Built ONCE per process: `who` asks about every lane in the register, and one
# find per record per lane would be a read nobody would run.
#
# CACHED IN A FILE for the reason `live_session_ids` gives, and this one was the
# more expensive of the two: `transcript_title` falls back to a `find` over the
# whole profiles tree, so a rebuild per lane was a filesystem walk per lane.
#
# THE LOWER-CASED TITLE AND ID ARE CARRIED rather than computed by the reader:
# `lc` is `printf | tr`, TWO PROCESSES, and `lane_forks` ran it on every entry of
# this map for every lane it was asked about — fifty lanes times however many
# live records, for two comparisons a `case` can make.

# ------------------------------------------- issue #39: DUPLICATE HOLDERS
#
# `lane_forks` answers one question — a LIVE session recorded under an id the
# row does NOT carry, wearing the lane's own transcript title — and it answers
# it well: Evidence 6's `--fork-session` daemon had a fresh id nothing had
# heard of. Measured 2026-09-14 (opensoft/openRepoTools#39): a cross-profile
# resume leaves a SECOND kind of stray behind that `lane_forks` cannot see at
# all — a `bg-pty-host` running `claude --session-id <X> --fork-session
# --resume <parent>.jsonl` under a background pty host, where a LATER
# `lane-start --no-launch` went on to bind `<X>` itself as the row's own
# session. Once that happens the fork's id IS an id the row carries,
# `lane_forks`' own exclusion (`case "$lf_ids" in *" $lf_sid "*) continue`)
# fires exactly as designed, and the daemon goes invisible to it — while a
# second live process now holds the one transcript Amendment 18(h) says
# exactly one process may hold. `lane-end --retire <pid>` refused it outright,
# and the retirement was a bare `kill -TERM`, outside every tool this estate
# has.
#
# THE PROCESS TABLE, NOT A SESSION RECORD'S `sessionId` FIELD, because this
# question is not about what a record CLAIMS its id is — the fork's own record
# may say `<X>`, which is exactly the id the row now also carries and exactly
# why `lane_forks` cannot use it — it is about the ARGV a live process was
# actually started with: a `--fork-session` invocation whose `--resume` path
# ends in one of THIS LANE's own transcript ids. Every id the row has ever
# carried is checked, not only the last (Amendment 6(b): a chained cell's
# earlier link is still this lane's transcript).
#
# `pgrep -f` FIRST, THEN `ps -o pid=,ppid=,args= -p` PER CANDIDATE, both forms
# already used elsewhere in this tree for the same reason: GNU and BSD/macOS
# agree on `-f` (match the full argument list) and on `-o field=` (each `=`
# suppresses that field's own header, so the frame needs no trimming) where
# they do not agree on a fixed-column `ps aux`. Scoping the `ps` call to one
# candidate pid at a time, rather than walking the whole table once, is what
# lets the exact form stay `-p <pid>` instead of a table-wide parse this file
# would then own two implementations of.
#
# THE ROW'S OWN LIVE HOLDER IS EXCLUDED, never reported and never touched,
# over the SAME implementation `live-holder` already calls (`live_holder`,
# over the published-union-local id set) — never a new liveness primitive. In
# the ordinary case this exclusion never fires: a lane's real interactive
# session is never started WITH `--fork-session` in its own argv, so nothing
# this read finds can coincide with it. It stays in because a fence that is
# usually a no-op is exactly what a fence should be, and `lane-end` asks the
# same question again, in words, before it sends a single signal.
#
# One line per surviving match: `<parent pid><US><child pid, or empty><US>
# <the matched uuid>` — `$US`, never a TAB. A CONFIRMED CHILD OF THE CI RUN ON
# PR #61: with a real, honest, DOCUMENTED-empty child slot (the line just
# above — "the child slot stays empty" is not a race-only rarity, it is this
# read's ordinary answer for a parent with no confirmable fork-session child),
# a bare TAB is one of bash `read`'s own IFS-WHITESPACE characters, so
# `IFS=$'\t' read -r a b c` on `"<parent>\t\t<uuid>"` — TWO adjacent tabs
# either side of the empty middle field — COLLAPSES them into ONE delimiter
# exactly as it collapses repeated spaces, silently shifting the uuid into
# `b` and leaving `c` empty. Measured: `tests-no-submodule` on e4f9054,
# `test_the_lane_helper_suite_passes` read the empty child as a parent still
# "STILL ALIVE" (its own argv check comparing against `$dh_uuid_lc=""` could
# match nothing) and the uuid as a pid — `pid <uuid> (child): gone`. `$US` is
# not IFS whitespace, so `read` never merges it with itself; both consumers in
# `lane-end` read this format with `IFS=$'\037'` for the same reason
# `live-holder`'s own multi-field line already does.
# 0 with rows, 8 with none, 1 where `pgrep` is missing or

# ------------------------------- decisions 6 and 7: THE LANE LISTING READ
#
# ONE READ, TWO LISTINGS. Decision 6 ratified the estate-wide `lanes`; decision
# 7 ratified `restart`'s per-repo listing and `/restart`'s. All three are the
# same rows with a different filter, so the filter is an argument here rather
# than three implementations in three commands — the rule clause (h) already
# gives `window-lane` and `session-lane`.
#
# READ-ONLY, out of `origin/<branch>` like every Amendment 7 read, and
# `LANES_NO_FETCH=1` is honoured by the one `log_sync` its caller makes. It
# never writes and never launches anything.
#
#   lanes_rows [--repo <owner/repo>] [--dir <path>] [--ws <ws>] [--all]
#
# `--repo` and `--dir` are decision 7's per-repo scope and they are an OR, not
# an AND: "rows whose register `home` is this checkout's `origin`, OR whose
# recorded `dir` is this checkout". That second half is a second use for clause
# (c)'s `dir` and an argument for recording it, because a lane's home
# repository and the checkout it sits in are not the same fact.
#
# Tab-separated, one line per lane, and the COLUMNS ARE THE DATA rather than a
# rendering: `restart` and `lanes` lay them out, and a third caller that wants
# a different shape does not need a fourth read.
#
#   <lane> <state> <workstation> <profile> <window> <last uuid> <dir>
#   <objects> <age> <restart line> <home> <forks>
#
# THE FIRST TEN ARE CLAUSE (j)'s TEN, IN CLAUSE (j)'s ORDER (A11 Addendum 4
# ruling 7): *"`lanes` and `restart` each render the subset of clause (j)'s ten
# columns their surface needs while the read carries all ten."* Column 10 — the
# restart line — used to be computed by each renderer, which is two
# implementations of one column; it is the read's now, so the two surfaces
# cannot disagree about which lane may be restarted or about what to type.
#
# `<home>` and `<forks>` are the read's own additions after the ten.
# `<forks>` is decision 8(e): the count of LIVE forks of this lane's transcript
# — a defect to retire, shown by both listings and never counted as a holder.
#
# Newest activity first, by the UTC of the lane's last lane-kind line. That is
# a clock and it decides nothing but the ORDER OF A LISTING, which is the one
# place a clock is allowed to: `swapped` ranks by landing order because a
# launcher BINDS from its first row, and nothing binds from this one.
# Every LIVE session id on this workstation with the window it is in, as
# `<sessionId><US><tmux target><US><name><US><pid>`. ONE pass over the records
# for the whole listing: `live_holder` answers about one lane and re-reads
# every record to do it, which for a 48-row register is 48 scans of the same
# directory.
#
# CACHED IN A FILE AND NOT IN A VARIABLE (A11 Addendum 4 ruling 12). Every
# caller invokes this inside `$( … )`, which is a SUBSHELL — so the variable the
# build set died with the build and the next lane rebuilt it, 564 records at a

# SCOPE, AFTER A11 Addendum 4 RULING 6 (ratified "a11 addendum 4 yes", ruling 6
# = NO to the workstation-scoped default):
#
#   default   EVERY lane the register and the logs know — clause (j) as
#             written. It used to be this workstation's, and that was never in
#             the contract: `window-lane` is scoped and the contract says so at
#             length (`R-A11-8`/RV-T7); this read is not. "List the lanes" on a
#             two-workstation estate means both.
#   --here    this workstation only. The old default, kept as an OPTION.
#   --ws <n>  a named workstation only, which implies the same narrowing.
#   --all     no narrowing of any kind: it CLEARS `--repo`, `--dir`, `--prefix`
#             and `--here`, so a caller that has narrowed can undo it in one
#             word. That is what the settlement means by "`--all` forces the
#             every-lane listing".
#
# `--prefix <repo>` is the LABEL fallback and nothing more: a lane whose log
# records NEITHER a home NOR a directory cannot be filed by either, and its
# name's `<repo>-` prefix is the only thing left. Amendment 7 calls that prefix
# a label rather than a fact, so it is used ONLY where the two facts are absent
# — never to override a home that disagrees with it, which is the case
# `openRepoTools#28` says must be SAID rather than filed twice.

    # path, the lane's own recorded directory and profile, asking nothing —
    # plus the pick, the attach and the elsewhere branch. A column naming a word
    # that is not on the person's PATH is a column they cannot type.
    #
    # A PAUSED LANE ONLY (clause (j) column 10, F-X20), and a PAUSED lane whose
    # record carries NO `profile` gets the form that works today with the
    # profile named as the one token the operator must supply — because a wrong
    # profile is a launch into another account and nothing here may guess one,
    # while a line that cannot be typed is worse than a column that says
    # `none`. Every other state gets `none`: a lane whose last act was its last
    # is not a lane a person restarts.

    # verbatim *"how do i start claude with that profile and that lane? do i use
    # lane command?"*, about a lane live in a DETACHED tmux session, where the
    # listing named the session and no act). A live lane is never started a
    # second time: clause (h) is one live process per transcript, and a
    # `lane-start` or a `pclaude` on a running lane is exactly the second one.

    # is why the CHOICE between them is made here, in the read both surfaces
    # share, and not in a renderer.

# --------------------- AMENDMENT 18 ADDENDUM 1: THE PICK'S TWO READS ---------
#
# `lane` (Addendum 1 (i-1), ratified 2026-09-14T14:05:54Z verbatim "ratify the
# addendum") renders THE SAME ROWS `lanes` renders — in three groups, with a
# number in front of each. Neither the grouping nor the next free position is
# that word's own: both are computed HERE, over the rows `lanes_rows` printed,
# because two surfaces computing one answer is how they come to disagree. That
# is the rule clause (h) already gives `window-lane` and `session-lane`, and the
# one A11 Addendum 4 ruling 7 gave column 10 after `lanes` and `restart` had
# each computed a restart line of its own.
#
# ROWS ON STDIN, like `sibling-filter` one screen down: the caller has already
# made the read and paid for it, and a subcommand that read the register a
# second time would double the cost of every pick to answer a question about
# the rows already in its hand. Neither of these two reads the register, the
# logs, the session records or the network at all.

# THE PARTITION, AND IT IS THE STATE COLUMN'S (clause (i-2)):
#
#   available   PARKED — a lane nobody holds — or A BINDING THIS HOST PROVES
#               DEAD: a lane whose last verb was STARTED or RESUMED, on this
#               workstation, with no live session record naming any of its ids.
#               `lanes_rows` has already made that proof, and it is the whole
#               difference between its `LIVE` and its `IDLE`.
#   live        LIVE: a live session record on this workstation names one of the
#               row's ids. The act is the ATTACH and never a second process.
#   elsewhere   a binding this host CANNOT prove dead, because the row is
#               another workstation's: the session records are local files, so
#               saying NOT LIVE about Raven from Eagle would be a claim this
#               machine has no way to make. Clause (c)'s handoff question.
#
# CLOSED AND DORMANT LANES LEAVE THE PICK (Amendment 19). A lane whose last act
# was its last is not a lane a person picks, and a pick that offered one would
# be offering to reopen something closed on purpose. `ENDED` and `RETIRED` are
# that set in today's vocabulary and `CLOSED`/`DORMANT` are the words the rows
# take under #42; both are named here, so the pick is right under either and
# the word does not have to move when the read does. They are still ROWS in

# THE NEXT FREE POSITION, over those same rows: clause (i-1)'s `f` answer, and
# the footer `lanes` has printed since Brett Heap's settlement of
# 2026-09-13T20:38:11Z. It is the LOWEST one NO ROW HOLDS and never the highest
# plus one, because handing out 12 while 3 has never been used grows a column
# nobody reads — and `lane-start` refuses a position that is taken, so this is a
# suggestion with a guard behind it and never an assertion.
#
# A POSITION A LANE HAS HELD IS RESERVED, ENDED AND RETIRED ROWS INCLUDED
# (Copilot round 7 on #45, `lanes-edit.sh:4839`, where this paragraph said
# positions "come back as lanes end" and the code has never done that). EVERY
# row on stdin is taken, whatever its state, and that is deliberate: a lane's
# identity is its name, its object log is `lanes/log/<lane>.md` and it is
# APPEND-ONLY, so a second lane at a retired position would write its life into
# the first one's file and every read of that log — who holds what, when it was
# claimed, which session paused it — would answer for two lanes at once. The
# register's row is the same story in one line. Positions are cheap; identities
# are not.
#
# A POSITION IS DIGITS WITH AN OPTIONAL TRAILING LETTER, which is
# `lane-start`'s own rule: `5a` and `5` are one position taken twice, because a
# lane may be re-cut and a re-cut position is not free, and it is the only
# reading under which `openxfactory-4-opendox-extraction` has no position at
# all. The comparison is case-insensitive on both sides, like every other lookup
# of a lane name in this file (Amendment 15).
# EVERY ROW OF THE REGISTER AND OF THE ARCHIVE, AS BARE NAMES — the rows the
# listing HIDES since Amendment 19(b), and the rows `archive-rows` has moved out
# of the register altogether under 19(d). Both are read out of THIS CHECKOUT-s
# files and neither is fetched: the rows on stdin already carry the published
# register (the caller has just rendered it), and this union can only move the
# position UP, which is the direction a position may safely move. `next-free`
# is exempt from the workspace guard, so no workspace at all is silence here.
# THE PUBLISHED ONES, WITH THIS CHECKOUT'S AS THE FALLBACK (Copilot round 1 on
# #93). Reading only the local files missed a row that is on `origin/<branch>`
# and not yet pulled here: hidden from the stdin rows by clause (b) and absent
# from this union, its position came back on offer — which is the one thing
# 19(b) exists to prevent. `register_text` and `archive_text` are the same two
# reads the listing makes, in R19's order.

# skill's step 1, `lane-start`'s directory rung 2 and `restart`'s, each with the
# same comment saying so), and each of the others is read by its own index. A
# record written before an amendment carries its fields EMPTY rather than
# guessed — Amendment 7(i)'s cutover rule, which is what makes a sixth and a
# seventh safe to add at all.
#
# WHICH LINE IS A LANE'S "LAST" IS FILE ORDER (R14), like every other state read
# here: a lane's log is append-only and single-writer, so a line further down
# the file is a line written later whatever the two UTC fields say — and this is
# the read a restart resolves its lane from, so letting a clock decide it would
# be the same fault Amendment 7 removed everywhere else.
#
# THE ROWS ARE ORDERED BY LANDING ORDER ON `origin/<branch>`, MOST RECENTLY
# LANDED FIRST — the position of the commit that ADDED each lane's PAUSED line,
# and never the UTC in it. File order does not reach across two lanes' files,
# and two lanes' UTCs are two clocks: they may be two workstations' (Amendment 7
# gives them no shared order at all) or one workstation's mid-jump — this one
# was observed stepping ±25 s in bursts, and a log commit landed whose content
# carried a UTC 26 s after its own committer date. Git's push serialization is
# the one order both lanes really share, and it is the same arbiter clause (f)
# already uses to decide a race. The UTC stays in the output as INFORMATION, and
# decides nothing.
#

# ============================================================================
# AMENDMENT 12 — THE NAME GUARD AND THE LOCK, WITH AMENDMENT 18(h)'S ONE READ
# ============================================================================
#
# **A LANE SESSION WORKS ONLY WHILE THREE NAMES ARE ONE** — the tmux WINDOW it
# runs in, the SESSION's own name, and the register ROW whose session cell ends
# on this transcript — **and otherwise the prompt is REFUSED** (exit 2), with
# the triple as it stands and the ONE command that cures it, filled in. Ratified
# 2026-09-13T18:20:44Z, "Ratify revision 2", with M1 "Type /rename into the
# pane"; `brettheap/new-workstation#22`/#23, opensoft/openRepoTools#25.
#
# WHY THE RULE NEEDED AN ENFORCEMENT. Amendment 2 has said since 2026-09-05 that
# a lane is its window's name and its session's name; nothing refused anything
# for eight days, and between 2026-09-10 and 2026-09-12 this very lane ran as
# `openRepoTools-3`, `-4`, … `-14` — a fresh title per `/resume`, in a window
# still named `claude`, in profiles that changed at every usage reset — and no
# row was ever written. `session_start_block` above says which lane a window is
# and "ALWAYS exits 0"; `window_session` "decides nothing". This is the surface
# that decides.
#
# THE LOCK (clause (h), Brett Heap's D5). Under the projects root the session
# name is not the person's to set freely; it is the lane's. The tooling sets it
# at every launch (`lane-start --name "$LANE"`, clause (c)) and again whenever it
# drifts — by TYPING `/rename <lane>` into the session's own tmux pane, which is
# the only mechanism a running session has (M1, "Type /rename into the pane"):
# the docs name `--name` at launch, `/rename`, and `Ctrl+R` in the picker, and
# nothing else — no hook output field, no environment variable, no settings key.
# A PERSON'S rename to another lane's name is not drift but an INSTRUCTION, and
# it is OFFERED back before it is obeyed: yes moves this window to that lane, no
# renames the session back.
#
# FAIL CLOSED (clause (d)). A mismatch refuses; so does an INDETERMINATE read —
# session records unreadable, tmux not answering, the register unreadable —
# naming the read, because a triple that cannot be verified is not a triple that
# agrees. Profile-only launches carrying exactly `CLAUDE_NO_LANE=1` are exempt
# from this guard. `claude --safe-mode` disables every hook, deliberate and
# visible in the prompt box; a session started that way is not a lane session
# and may not write the register or claim an object.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, AND THE ONE WAY IT FAILS OPEN. Measured on Eagle 2026-09-14
# against 329 session records and a 1.3 MB register: the register read is ~2 s
# wall and the `grep -l` over every profile's records ~0.4 s, so a refusal lands
# inside the ratified `timeout 5`. A hook that EXCEEDS its timeout is killed, and
# a killed hook does not exit 2 — so the timeout is the one path on which this
# guard fails open. It is the amendment's own number and is left at it; the
# cheap tests are made first so that the two reads happen only where they decide
# something.
#
# IT NEVER FETCHES. `session-start`'s R-A8-1 argument applies here several times
# over — that hook runs once per session and this one runs at EVERY PROMPT — so
# the row is read from `origin/<branch>` AS THIS CHECKOUT LAST HAD IT (R19, the
# same `register_text` every other state read takes) and the network is never
# opened. "The register not fetchable" (clause (d)) is therefore the READ
# failing, and that refuses.

# A LANE NAME IS `<repo>-<position>` (THE LANE RULE), and this is the predicate
# for it: `check_lane_name`'s character fence, plus a LAST `-` followed by
# digits. It agrees with `lane_start_args` by construction — that function
# prints `--dir <path> <lane>` for exactly the names this refuses — and the two
# exist separately because one answers a question and the other builds a command
# line. A name the register has a row for is a lane whatever its shape
# (`browser-ui-repair` is one); this asks only whether the two arguments of
# `lane-start` can be read OUT of a name nobody has a row for yet, which is what
# rows 1 and 6 of the table below need.

# that has already been resolved through it, so a literal prefix test answers
# "outside the projects root" about every estate session there is. Both the
# typed path and its `pwd -P` are compared, and a match on either is inside:
# the direction that errs toward the guard APPLYING is the safe one, because

# ------------------------------------- AMENDMENT 18(h): ONE LIVE PROCESS
#
# *"A transcript (one session id) is held by ONE live process. The harness can
# fork one (`--fork-session`, minting a new id in a background pty host) or
# resume one twice, and the tooling refuses to build on either."* Ratified
# 2026-09-14T13:15:18Z as revision 4 of Amendment 18;
# `brettheap/new-workstation#34`, opensoft/openRepoTools#39.
#
# MEASURED FOUR TIMES ON 2026-09-14, the fourth at 18:14Z: a `bg` record in ONE
# profile's `sessions/` and an interactive record in ANOTHER's, both live, both
# carrying one `sessionId` — which is why this sweeps EVERY profile's directory
# and not the asking session's. On a launcher-configured workstation every
# profile's `projects/` is one shared directory, so a transcript needs no move
# to be resumed under another profile and a duplicate is one `--resume` away.
#
# THREE CALLERS, ONE IMPLEMENTATION, for the reason clause (h) already gives
# `window-lane`: `lane-start` refuses to bind or resume an id another process
# holds, `lane-end --retire <pid>` retires that process, and the prompt guard
# refuses every prompt inside it. A rule implemented three times is a rule three
# surfaces come to disagree about.
#
# IT IS BUILT ON A `grep -l`, NOT ON `session_records`. This runs at every prompt
# under a five-second timeout, and the one-pass parse is a per-process CACHE that
# the first caller pays for in full — 329 records here. The question asked is
# about ONE id the harness has already handed the hook, so the cheap shape is the
# one `live_holder` uses: one grep for the id, then a parse of the one or two
# files that match. Measured at ~0.4 s against those 329.
#
#   <pid><US><kind><US><tmux|none><US><profile><US><where><US><verdict><US><file>
#
# `where` is for a person to read — `window <session>:<@id>`, the same with
# ` (gone)` where the agreement rule above refuses it, or `bg`.
#
# THE VERDICT IS THE WHOLE OF THE JUDGEMENT, and it has four values because
# THREE IN-FORCE RULES MEET HERE AND NONE OF THEM MAY BE OVERTURNED BY THIS ONE:
#
#   here        the record is THIS window's own process — its `tmux` names this
#               window, or its pid is this pane's or below it: `record_is_here`'s
#               TIERS 2 AND 3, and its tier 1 is left out because it cannot
#               discriminate here. That tier asks whether the record's
#               `sessionId` is `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, and every candidate in
#               this set carries the very id being tested — so on the asking
#               session's own transcript it would answer `here` for the
#               duplicate too, which is the one reading this function exists to
#               prevent.
#   companion   not this window's, in the SAME profile's `sessions/` as this
#               window's own record of this id, AND NOT A SESSION RECORD.
#               AMENDMENT 8, RULING (g) names exactly one such thing: *"Beside
#               the interactive process in the pane the harness runs a companion:
#               `kind: bg`, no `tmux`, no `nameSource`, its own pid, and THE SAME
#               `sessionId` … Records that share a `sessionId` are one session,
#               not a queue of rival holders, and there is no contest between
#               them to win."* The harness writes a session's own records under
#               that session's own `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so same-profile is what
#               "the harness's own second record of one session" looks like —
#               and the `kind` is what tells that record apart from a SECOND
#               INTERACTIVE PROCESS in the same directory, which is one
#               transcript resumed twice and is 18(h)'s own case rather than the
#               harness's companion. The profile alone read a second `--resume`
#               UNDER ONE PROFILE as benign (Copilot round 1 on this PR), and
#               that is the cheapest way there is to make two live processes on
#               one transcript: no move, no swap, one command.
#               THE KIND IS `bg` AND NOTHING ELSE IS READ AS ONE. `not a session
#               record` was the first spelling of this test and it was too wide
#               by exactly the kinds nobody has ruled on: this suite's own
#               interactive fork carries `kind: user`
#               (`tests/test_lane_helpers.sh`, Amendment 11 clause (k)), and any
#               kind a later harness invents would have arrived here as the
#               harness's benign companion (Copilot round 2 on this PR). Ruling
#               (g) names ONE shape to pass over, so that shape is what this
#               matches; every other live record on this id — known kind or not,
#               and a record too old to carry a `kind` at all, which pass 1
#               writes down as `interactive` — is a duplicate, which is the
#               closed direction.
#   duplicate   EVERY OTHER live record carrying this id: a session record in
#               another window of this same profile, or any record at all in
#               ANOTHER profile's `sessions/` beside this window's own. That is
#               AMENDMENT 18(h)'s second live process. The MEASURED shape was the
#               second one — four times on 2026-09-14, the last at 18:14Z, the
#               second record sat in another profile's directory, and 18(h) says
#               why, *"on a launcher-configured workstation every profile's
#               `projects/` is one shared directory … which is also why a
#               duplicate is one `--resume` away"* — but the rule it states is
#               one live PROCESS per transcript, not one per profile.
#   unrelated   THIS WINDOW CARRIES NO RECORD OF THIS TRANSCRIPT AT ALL, so this
#               read says nothing about the processes that do. That is not
#               timidity: `live_holder` answers "is any session this row names
#               alive" and Amendment 8(f) rules an ORPHAN reported and never
#               refused, while `lane_forks` answers about a fork. A rule that
#               counted every live record here would overturn both from a read
#               that was not asked about either. ONE CALLER TAKES IT AS A
#               BLOCKER ANYWAY AND SAYS SO WHERE IT DOES: `lane-start`'s
#               `dup_check`, asked about the ONE id a run is about to resume,
#               where an `unrelated` holder is a second live process on the very
#               file that run is about to open (Amendment 18(h), *"never
#               launches a second resume of it"*). That is a narrower question
#               than this verdict answers, so the narrowing lives at that call
#               site and not in this table.

# ===================== AMENDMENT 18(b) — THE BINDING, READ ==================
#
# **A LANE HAS ONE BINDING**: the `host`, `container` and `window` of its last
# lane-kind line that is `STARTED` or `RESUMED` with no `PAUSED`, `ENDED` or
# `RETIRED` after it. A lane whose last lane-kind line is one of those three, or
# that has none, is FREE. Ratified 2026-09-14T13:15:18Z as revision 4.
#
# ONE SCAN ANSWERS FOUR QUESTIONS, because three surfaces ask them of the same
# stream and a second pass is a second answer: the `binding` read (clause (c)'s
# refusal), the prompt guard's clause (d) — *"a `HANDOFF-REQUESTED` newer than
# its own binding and not yet answered"* — its clause (e) — *"a `PAUSED` newer
# than the binding that this session did not write"* — and `request-handoff`'s
# wait, which ends when the release arrives.
#
# IT IS FILE ORDER AND NEVER A CLOCK (R14). A lane's log is append-only and
# single-writer, so a line further down the file is a line written later
# whatever the two UTC fields say — and "newer than the binding" here means
# BELOW it in the file, which is the only order two lines of one lane really
# share. The UTC is carried out as information, for the sentence a person reads.
#
# A FORK'S LINE IS NOT THE LANE'S (decision 8(c), A11 Addendum 4 ruling 8), so a
# payload opening `fork ` is skipped exactly as `lane_row_facts` skips it: a
# `RETIRED` about a fork would read as the LANE being retired, which is the
# opposite of what happened.
#
# A LINE WRITTEN BEFORE AMENDMENT 18(a) CARRIES NONE OF THE THREE SUB-FIELDS AND
# STAYS VALID: its binding is *"the window on the row's workstation, which is
# what they read today"*. So `host` falls back to the line's own `@<ws>` — which
# is the Rule 10 workstation, and is also what a container with no export writes
# into `host` deliberately — and `container` falls back to `none`. Amendment
# 7(i)'s cutover rule, with the fallback the clause itself names.
#
#   1 state       bound · requested · released · free

# there let a record whose `host` is another machine read as `here` wherever the
# two names happened to coincide — and `lane-start` then skips the fence, which
# is the one refusal this clause exists to make.

  # window — and `lane <name>` MOVES a live lane's window into the asking
  # session (Addendum 1 (i-2)), which leaves the record naming the session it
  # came from while the very same window, with the very same id, is alive one
  # session along. Answered `gone`, that move would make a RUNNING lane read as
  # a dead binding, and `gone` is the one answer that hands `lane-start` and
  # `lane` the takeover path: a second process on a lane whose window a person
  # had just pulled in front of themselves.
  #
  # So the two are separated and only the first is DEAD. The second is
  # `unknown` — not this place's to pronounce, which is clause (b)'s own posture
  # everywhere else — and it costs the takeover path exactly the case where an
  # id has been reused, which was never a proof of death either. The RECORD
  # going stale under a move is a real gap and it is filed, not papered over
  # here: `lane` writes nothing to the register by design (Addendum 1), so
  # keeping that field current is an act somebody has to rule on
  # (opensoft/openRepoTools#95).
  #
  # AND AN EMPTY ANSWER IS TWO FACTS, OF WHICH ONLY ONE IS DEAD (Copilot round 9
  # on openRepoTools#83). `bws_now` comes back EMPTY both where the id resolves
  # nowhere and where there is NO SERVER TO ASK AT ALL — a container the host's
  # socket was never mounted into, a server not started yet, a `$TMUX_TMPDIR`
  # that differs, a socket this user cannot read. AND THE STATUS IS NOT THE
  # DISCRIMINATOR: measured on tmux 3.4, an id that resolves nowhere on a server
  # that IS there answers `0` with an empty stdout, while no server at all
  # answers 1 with an empty stdout and `error connecting to … (No such file or
  # directory)` on stderr — which `tmux_window_field` sends to `/dev/null` and
  # this read discards with `|| :`. `command -v tmux` catches only the
  # workstation that has no tmux BINARY, and the two are not the same
  # workstation. Read as `gone`, the second one makes
  # EVERY binding of every other container on this host read DEAD — the one
  # answer that hands `lane-start` and `lane` the takeover path — which is this
  # clause's own collision reached through its own exception, on the very estate
  # the exception was written for. The contract three lines above already says
  # *"no tmux to ask"* is `unknown`; this is the code saying it too.

# ============ AMENDMENT 18(c)/(d)/(e) — THE SECOND PLACE ASKS ===============
#
# *"`lane-start <repo> <n>` and `restart <lane>` run from a place that is not the
# binding — a different `host`, `container` or `window` — REFUSE to bind. … A
# `y`, or the flag `--request-handoff` from a caller with no terminal, is THE
# REQUEST, and it is written before anything else is tried … Then, WHERE THE
# BOUND PANE IS ON THIS TMUX SERVER, the requester also types `/handoff --exit
# requested by <uuid>@<host>/<container>` into that pane … The requester then
# WAITS … When one arrives the lane is free and the requester binds as it would
# have."*
#
# THE MECHANISM IS HERE AND THE QUESTION IS AT THE DOOR. `lane-start` and `lane`
# each ASK in their own words — one is a launch that has already been typed, the
# other a pick out of a listing — and both then call THIS, so the line that is
# written, the pane that is typed into, the interval that is polled and the
# refusal that ends an empty wait are one implementation. That is the rule
# clause (h) gives `window-lane` and the one A11 Addendum 4 ruling 7 gave column
# 10 after two surfaces had each computed a restart line of their own.
#
# THE ORDER IS THE CLAUSE'S AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING: the line is written and
# PUSHED FIRST, so that a bound session anywhere can read it from `origin`, and
# only then is the pane typed into — which is an optimisation for the same-host
# case and never the request itself. A request that could not be written is not
# a request, and nothing is typed on the strength of one.
#
#   $LANES_POLL_SECONDS   the poll interval (default 15) — the one seam, and it
#                         is the suite's: a case that must watch a wait end
#                         cannot spend fifteen seconds per poll doing it.

# the harness's own `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, and the live record of THIS

# the reasoning that the harness is a node program and this format reports the
# process rather than the wrapper; MEASURED on Eagle 2026-09-14T23:4xZ, across
# the twelve panes tmux had, it is not: eleven lane panes report `claude`, two
# report `bash` (a pane whose session is under a launcher wrapper) and one
# `zsh`, and no pane reports `node` at all. So `node` bought nothing here and
# would have let a stray Node REPL in a pane take `/rename <lane>` as input
# (Copilot round 4 on this PR). A pane this refuses is not a lock that failed:
# the caller prints the line for the person to type, which is the cure — and on
# this estate today the `bash` panes are exactly where they will read it.

  # ---- AMENDMENT 18 CLAUSES (d) AND (e), THE BOUND SESSION'S TWO ANSWERS.
  # Both are reads of THIS lane's own object log, made at this point for the
  # reason (h)'s count above is made here: the lane is known, nothing has been
  # judged yet, and a refusal here costs the prompt and nothing else.
  #
  #   (d) a `HANDOFF-REQUESTED` newer than this session's binding and not yet
  #       answered by a `PAUSED` of its own -> refuse this ONE prompt, name who
  #       asked and from where, and type `/handoff --exit requested by …` into
  #       this pane ((h)1's mechanism, which `guard_type` already is). *"The
  #       person at the bound pane sees the refusal and the handoff run; nothing
  #       they typed is lost, because the refused prompt is theirs to type again
  #       in the new place."*
  #   (e) a `PAUSED` newer than the binding that THIS session did not write ->
  #       refuse EVERY prompt from then on, naming the line and who forced it,
  #       until the person here hands off or ends the session. *"Two places
  #       never both write a lane in silence; the worst a `--force` can do is
  #       make the old place stop, loudly."*
  #
  # BOTH ARE GATED ON THE BINDING BEING THIS SESSION'S, and the gate has two
  # disjuncts because a lane's transcript changes under it: the binding's
  # `session` field is this uuid, OR the binding's WINDOW is this window — which
  # is the `/clear`, the usage reset and the profile switch, where the harness
  # minted a new id and the row has not caught up. Without the second, a request
  # aimed at a lane that had been cleared would be answered by nobody; without
  # the first, a session in a window that merely carries the name would answer
  # for somebody else's binding.
  #
  # WHAT IT COSTS, MEASURED: `lanes-edit.sh binding openRepoTools-3` against this
# estate's live register is **0.17 s** wall (2026-09-15), because it is one
# `git show` of ONE lane's log and one awk — not the register read the triple
# above already paid for. The guard's own budget is the amendment's `timeout 5`,
# and the two reads it makes before this one measured ~2 s and ~0.4 s.
#
# A READ THAT FAILED IS NOT A LANE WITH NOTHING PENDING — but it is not a
  # refusal either, and that is a narrowing this guard makes deliberately.
  # Clause (d) is fail-closed about the READS THAT BUILD THE TRIPLE; these two
  # decide whether ANOTHER PLACE has asked for the lane, and a log that cannot
  # be read there costs at worst a request answered one prompt later, while
  # refusing on it would block every prompt of every lane on a workstation whose
  # `origin` is briefly unreadable. It is said rather than swallowed.
  #
  # AND ONLY WHERE THIS WINDOW NAMES A LANE. With no lane there is no log to
  # read and no binding to be asked for; the row below this block is the one
  # that refuses a window naming none, and it says the right thing about it.

#
# MEASURED, AND IT IS A LOOP AND NOT A BLEMISH. In the suite: choice `2` moved the
# window to `repoGD-2`, whose row then read `STARTED by 7a01ae69…` while this
# session was `aaaa0012-1111…`. The NEXT prompt therefore finds a lane window
# whose row does not name this transcript — the last row of the (b) table — and
# refuses with `lane-start --no-launch repoGD 2`, which vetoes for the same
# reason and changes nothing. A blocking hook that refuses for ever, on a state
# it created by obeying the person, is the worst outcome this surface has.
#
# SO THE GUARD MAKES THE LAST WRITE ITSELF, and only after the person's `2`.
# That is not a hole in veto 1: the veto exists for the take nobody asked for —
# *"`lane-start openXfactory-5` typed from a window named `openRepoProject-1`"*,
# Evidence 2(b) — and clause (h) rule 4's own limit is that the lock *"never
# moves a uuid between rows WITHOUT the person's `yes`"*. Here there is one —
# choice `2` is that yes in the numbered offer — on the record, answered at this
# very prompt.
#
# THE ANCHOR DISCIPLINE IS `lane-start`'s, unvaried: the anchor is the PUBLISHED
# last id, so a checkout whose copy of the row is older than the one that landed
# REFUSES rather than writing a cell that no longer matches; a row whose cell
# records no uuid at all is anchored on `none recorded`, the one other text a
# cell this act can meet carries, and anything else prints the act and guesses
# at nothing.
#
#   0  the cell now ends on this uuid (it already did, or this appended it)
#   1  it does not, and the reason has been printed with the act that fixes it

# Rule 1 is one act: the three reads, the local line, and the comment that
# another person reads. The LOG is authoritative for a claim made through
# `claim` — a log line IS a live claim for Rule 1 purposes — and the GitHub
# comment is the copy that a person outside this estate can see.
# --no-github skips every call here, which is what the tests and an offline
# lane run with.

# THE SIBLING READS NAME THE OBJECT, NOT ITS DIGITS (Amendment 8). Rule 1's
# reads 2 and 3 searched for the bare slug as a SUBSTRING, and a number is a
# substring of almost everything. Measured live on 2026-09-12 against the
# governing repository, `gh pr list --search 15` answered with PR #16 and PR
# #10 — GitHub had matched the digits inside "**15 of the register's 41 rows**"
# — and `ls-remote | grep 15` answered with a branch whose 40-character sha
# merely contains them, all under the heading "existing work on this object".
# A sibling that does not NAME the object is not evidence about it, and evidence
# that is not evidence is how a lane talks itself out of a claim it should make.
#
# TWO READS, TWO TESTS, because the two inputs are not the same kind of text.
#   pr      `gh pr list`'s rows, which are prose. A number in prose is a
#           number; a REFERENCE is `#<n>`, so the hash is required — and its
#           LEFT side is not bounded, because the canonical spelling of the
#           thing being looked for is `owner/repo#15` and the character before
#           the `#` is a letter. A row whose FIRST field is the number itself
#           is kept too: that is the PR the object IS.
#   branch  `ls-remote`'s refs, which are names. `issue-15-fix` names the
#           object and carries no hash, so the bare number as a whole token is
#           the test — after the leading sha is stripped, so a branch is matched
#           by its name and never by the digits of the commit it points at.
# An OpenSpec change directory has a word for a slug and takes the whole-token
# test in both modes.
#
# AND READ 2 FILTERS OVER THE BODY. `gh pr list`'s columns are number, title,
# branch and state; the reference that makes a PR a sibling is almost always in
# its BODY, which is what GitHub's own search matched and what the columns do
# not carry. Filtering the columns alone dropped PR #16 — the PR for this very
# issue, whose body says `brettheap/new-workstation#15` twice — while a filter
# with the hash optional kept #10 instead. So the body is fetched, flattened to
# one line, used for the test, and cut off again before anything is printed:
# under-reporting a sibling is the direction that lets a lane claim what
# somebody is already working on, and it is the one direction Rule 1 cannot

# ------------------------------- AMENDMENT 13(e): THE MIGRATION, ONE ACT -----
#
# `migrate-state-cells` empties every `state` cell of its diary INTO the lane's
# own log, once, on Brett Heap's word (ratified decision O3: after the writer
# changes are installed on both workstations — a cell must stop growing before
# it is emptied). It is a DRY RUN unless `--yes` is passed, and it REFUSES to
# run at all when no cell holds a ` · ` entry, so a second run is a no-op that
# says so.
#
# NOTHING IS DELETED. The appended narrative exists in git history AND in
# `lanes/archive/LANES-pre-amendment-13-<UTC>.md`, written in this same commit,
# AND in the logs — three times over, which is the posture Amendment 3 took
# after the 2026-09-08 loss.
#
# WHAT A ROW BECOMES. Its cell is split on ` · ` into entries, in cell order
# (the cell grew by appending, so that is oldest first). Each entry becomes one
# line in `lanes/log/<lane>.md`: `RULED` where the entry begins with RULING,
# RULINGS or RATIFIED, else `NOTED`; the entry's own leading timestamp becomes
# the line's UTC field rather than being repeated inside its text, and every
# other character of the entry is carried verbatim — including the ` — ` these
# entries are full of, which the log's parser reads as prose because a
# lane-kind line's free text is introduced by the ` — ` right after its object.
# The cell is then REPLACED by the state derived from the LAST entry's leading
# verb where that verb is one of clause (a)'s, else by `MIGRATED`.
#
# THE FOUR FIELDS THAT ARE NOT IN THE ENTRY come from the row: the UTC of an
# entry that carries none is the row's `started` (a date-only `started` is read
# as midnight UTC that day, and the register's older minute-precision form is
# accepted as Amendment 7(b) already accepts it); the session is the LAST uuid
# of the row's session cell; the workstation is the first `/`-separated part of
# the row's own column.
#
# AND A ROW THAT CANNOT BE MIGRATED IS SKIPPED AND NAMED, never guessed at and
# never half-written. Its cell keeps its history, so a re-run after the row is
# fixed by hand migrates exactly that row. Five reasons, all of them visible in
# the dry run: an ambiguous row (more than six ` | ` separators — see
# `row_split_state_cell`); a row whose session cell holds NO transcript uuid, so
# the line could only name `unknown` in the one field this log must never carry
# it in; two rows whose lane names differ only by case (Amendment 15(d)'s hand
# merge); a lane whose object log is two files, or is published under a
# spelling this checkout does not have; and a name that is not a lane name.
# Measured against the live register on 2026-09-15 (52 rows): 20 rows migrate,
# 1 has no uuid, 2 are ambiguous, and 29 hold no ` · ` entry at all and are
# already one phrase.
#
# THE WORKSTATION IS A TOKEN OR IT IS `unknown`. Twelve of the live register's
# rows carry `<workstation? — owner fills>` in that column, and that placeholder
# holds a ` — `: written into the `session <uuid>@<ws>` field it would put a
# THIRD ` — ` in the line, ahead of the object, and the log's own parser would
# read the verb and the fields out of the wrong halves for ever. So the column
# is read up to its first ` / `, and anything that is not one plain token
# (letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`) is recorded as `unknown` — which is inert
# here: no reader computes a lane's state, its window or its workstation from a
# narrative line (Amendment 13(b)).

# THESE FOUR ASSIGN A GLOBAL AND RETURN, rather than printing — the idiom
# `table_lookup` states one screen up, for the same reason: *"a function whose
# answer is taken with `$( … )` forks, which is the cost this exists to avoid"*.
# They are asked once PER ENTRY, and the live register holds 2,206 entries
# across its twenty diary cells. Measured on a copy of it, 2026-09-15: the
# printing form took 94 seconds of a dry run, five forks an entry; this one
# takes eleven.

# ------------------- AMENDMENT 19(c): THE SWEEP, ONE COMMIT OR NONE ---------
#
# `lane-end --retire-dormant <repo>` is the word a person types, the dry run
# they read and the `--yes` they answer with; THIS is the write underneath it.
# It is a verb of its own because the sweep touches many rows and many logs and
# is ONE commit — the shape `migrate-state-cells` has one screen up, for the
# same reason: a half-published sweep is a register whose rows and whose logs
# disagree about which lanes are finished.
#
# WHAT IT WRITES PER LANE, and clause (c) spells it out character by character:
#   `lanes/log/<lane>.md` gains ONE line —
#     RETIRED — lane <lane>, session <uuid>@<ws>, <UTC>, lane:<lane>
#       → retired-dormant by lane <writer>; reason <why>; was: <the cell's head>
#   and the row's state cell becomes  `RETIRED · <UTC> · <why>; was: <head>`.
#
# THE PAYLOAD ON A `RETIRED` IS THIS AMENDMENT'S OWN. Amendment 7(b) gives
# `RETIRED` no payload and Amendment 11 clause (c) keeps it that way — which is
# why `lane-end`'s fork retire is a DOOR that writes nothing at all. Amendment
# 19 is later, ratified as drafted, and spells this line out in full: the row's
# own last words are carried into the log so that nothing the row said is lost
# when the row stops saying it. That is the whole of the exception, and it is
# this line and no other.
#
# THE CELL IS AMENDMENT 13(a)'s PHRASE, NOT CLAUSE (c)'s LITERAL TEXT. Clause
# (c) writes the cell as `RETIRED <UTC> · <why> · was: <head>` — four parts
# where 13(a)'s cell has three, and a first word of `RETIRED <UTC>`, which is a
# state no reader of Rule 6 or of the listing knows. The phrase that carries the
# same four facts under the grammar every other writer obeys is
# `RETIRED · <UTC> · <why>; was: <head>`, and it goes through `row_state_check`
# — the gate `set-row-state` uses — so the 240-character cap, the `|` and the
# second ` · ` are refused here exactly as they are there. The `|` a legacy cell
# may carry is replaced by `/` in the ROW (it would forge a cell boundary) and
# kept VERBATIM in the log line, which is not a table.
#
# THE THREE REFUSALS ARE CLAUSE (c)'s: a lane a live session holds on this
# workstation, a row whose log already carries a lane-kind line other than
# `ENDED`/`RETIRED` (a parked lane is not dormant), and — in `lane-end`, which
# is the word that finds them — a repository with no dormant row at all.
# ANY ONE OF THEM REFUSES THE WHOLE RUN, before a byte is written: this is one
# commit, so it is one decision.

# ------------------- AMENDMENT 19(d): THE ARCHIVE, A SECOND ACT ON A SECOND
#                     WORD
#
# `archive-rows <repo>` MOVES every `RETIRED` row of `<repo>` out of
# `lanes/LANES.md` and into `lanes/archive/LANES-retired.md`, in ONE commit
# whose message names each lane moved. Rule 9 holds either way — a row is one
# `git show` away — so this is for a register a person wants SHORTER and is
# never a requirement, and nothing reads a row differently for having moved:
# `register_lanes`, `lanes_register_index` and `lane_position_rows` all read
# the archive beside the register, which is the amendment's own sentence
# (*"every reader of the next free position and `lanes --closed` read the
# archive too"*). A retired `<repo>-<n>` is never reissued.
#
# WHICH ROWS: the lane name's head — everything before its LAST hyphen — is the
# repository, compared without regard to case, which is `lane_next_free`'s rule
# for the same question and not a second one; and the state cell names `RETIRED`
# by `mig_lead_state`, the one reader of a cell's leading state word, so a
# legacy cell and Amendment 13's phrase are read by the same code.

# ============================================================================
# THE SEAM: A MANAGED-OWNED LANE IS NOT THIS TOOLING'S
# ============================================================================
#
# Brett Heap's ruling of 2026-10-04, verbatim: "managed ledger owns enrolled
# lanes; #97 owns legacy — rework both". A lane the managed ledger has enrolled
# carries a MANAGED-OWNER MARKER in its register row's state cell, written by
# that ledger's own writer; every lane without one is a LEGACY lane, and the
# legacy lane tooling in this file — the lifecycle below, the object log's
# lane-kind lines, the sweep, the row writers — answers for legacy lanes only.
#
# THE RULE, which is the ported reader's own ("no malformed marker may be
# downgraded to absence"):
#   * a VALID marker is a managed lane: every legacy write refuses it with 2,
#     names the owner, and writes nothing;
#   * managed-owner vocabulary that does NOT parse — a malformed marker, a row
#     that is not seven columns, an empty owner — or a register that could not
#     be read is UNKNOWN: refused with 1, and nothing is written;
#   * no vocabulary at all is a legacy lane, and everything here runs exactly
#     as it did.
#
# PROVENANCE. The block between the two markers below is
# `3c26041:lanes-edit.sh:776-898` — the projection reader of branch
# `001-separate-swap-ctx-handoff` (its T019) — ported VERBATIM: not one byte of
# it differs, so that when that branch's T024 lands, the merge of the two is
# "keep either", and this file's `lane_is_managed_owned` becomes that branch's
# `managed_legacy_check`. The proof is an empty diff:
#   diff <(git show 3c26041:lanes-edit.sh | sed -n 776,898p) \
#        <(sed -n '/^# --- BEGIN ported from 3c26041/,/^# --- END ported from 3c26041/p' lanes-edit.sh | sed '1d;$d')
# Its four dependencies — `row_split_state_cell`, `rstrip_spaces`, `lc` and
# `row_of_lane` — are byte-identical in this file and in that one.

# ============================================================================
# THE CRASH-CONSISTENT LANE LIFECYCLE AND THE WORKTREE INVENTORY
# (openspec/changes/add-crash-consistent-lane-worktree-recovery,
#  opensoft/openRepoTools#91)
# ============================================================================
#
# **A LANE IS `RUNNING`, `SWAPPING`, `SWAPPED` OR `CLOSED`, and which of those
# it is, with no live holder, is what says where it stopped.** A session can
# run out of tokens BEFORE the handoff, AFTER it began and before it finished,
# or after it finished — and until this section those three left the same
# evidence: a lane whose last lane-kind line was a `STARTED`/`RESUMED` (which
# is also what a lane that is running looks like) or a `PAUSED` (which is also
# what a clean swap looks like). The two crash kinds had no word.
#
# WHAT IS NEW AND WHAT IS NOT. Nothing about the append-only log changes: its
# five STATE verbs are Amendment 7's and this section adds no lane-kind verb at
# all (Amendment 18(g)'s `HANDOFF-REQUESTED` is the sixth lane-kind verb, and it
# changes no state), so `swapped_candidates`, `lane_row_facts`,
# `lane_payload_field`, `lane-last`, `who` and `lane-end` read exactly what they
# read before. What is added is a
# SNAPSHOT beside that history — one small file per lane, replaced atomically
# under this file's own mutex — carrying the state word, a monotonic
# GENERATION, the OPERATION ID of the transition in flight, and the owner. The
# log stays the provenance; the snapshot is the cheap current-state read that
# an append-only file cannot give a compare-and-swap.
#
# WHERE IT LIVES, AND WHY IT IS NOT IN THE REGISTER AND NOT IN A WORKTREE.
#   * NOT IN THE REGISTER. `lanes/LANES.md` is one file shared by every lane on
#     every workstation and every write of it is a commit, a pull --rebase and
#     a push (Amendment 5). A transition is taken three times per handoff and
#     must be able to happen with no network at all.
#   * NOT INSIDE A GIT WORKTREE. Orchestration metadata written into a checkout
#     dirties it, is committed by accident, and disappears with the very
#     directory whose loss it is meant to explain.
#   * SO: a LOCAL control root beside the lane's own checkouts, derived in this
#     order and never from the caller's current directory —
#       1. `$LANES_LANE_STATE_ROOT/<lane>`, the explicit override and the
#          suite's seam;
#       2. `<parent of the lane's recorded `dir`>/.lane-state/<lane>` — the
#          same parent the lane's own `.lane-worktrees/<lane>` root sits in,
#          and `dir` is Amendment 11(c)'s recorded field, not a guess;
#       3. `$PROJECTS_ROOT/.lane-state/<lane>`, for a lane whose record names
#          no directory yet.
#     No answer is 8, "this lane has no control root", exactly as `lane-dir`
#     answers 8 for a lane that has not started under Amendment 11 — and the
#     pre-cutover lane is the ordinary case, not a failure (Amendment 7(i)).
#
# IT IS WRITTEN WHERE `R-A11-14` STOPS THE REGISTER AND THE OBJECT LOG. That
# rule refuses a record FILED UNDER A WORKSTATION where no workstation is
# configured, because such a record is unfindable by every restart of every
# workstation. The snapshot is filed under nothing: it is local to the machine
# that wrote it, it is never committed and it never leaves. So a container with
# no `$LANES_WORKSTATION` still keeps a lifecycle it can recover itself from,
# and these two writers are deliberately NOT in the dispatcher's workstation
# guard above.
#
# THE FENCE. Every transition carries `generation` (monotonic) and
# `operation` (unique to one handoff). `set-lane-state --expect` names the
# state, and optionally the generation and the operation, the caller believes
# it is moving from; the write happens only where all three still match, and
# otherwise NOTHING is written and the exit is 7 — the estate's "another act
# got there first", which is what `claim` already spends it on. That is the
# whole of what stops a `/handoff` that stalled for an hour from marking a lane
# `SWAPPED` after somebody has recovered and resumed it.
#
# WHO WRITES `RUNNING`. The confirming act, and never the SessionStart hook:
# `session-start` NEVER WRITES, never touches the network and ALWAYS EXITS 0
# (Amendment 8, R-A8-1), which is what makes it safe in front of every session
# on the workstation. The act that actually proves lane, transcript, agent,
# directory and binding is `lane-start` (with or without `--no-launch`), and
# the proof it leaves is its `STARTED`/`RESUMED` line — so the snapshot follows
# THAT line, in `write_event`, from any caller. `ENDED`/`RETIRED` become
# `CLOSED` by the same rule. A `PAUSED` moves nothing: the two-phase transition
# around it belongs to `lane-handoff`, which takes `SWAPPING` before it polls
# anything and `SWAPPED` only after every mandatory write has landed.

# no control root is silent, because a lane that has not started under Amendment
# 11 has no directory to derive one from and that is the ordinary pre-cutover
# case.
#
# IT IS SERIALIZED AND IT IS FENCED (Copilot round 5 on openRepoTools#97). What
# a confirmed `STARTED`/`RESUMED` is entitled to overwrite is the state THIS
# WRITE SAW — advancing the generation over a `SWAPPING` it superseded is the
# whole point of writing it — and what it is never entitled to overwrite is a
# state that arrived AFTER it. The two are the same act read at different
# moments, so they are told apart the only way they can be: the snapshot is read
# under the same mutex `set-lane-state` takes, and compared with the pre-image
# `write_event` took before this event's own line landed. Unequal means another
# act moved the lane while this one was being written — a recovery, a handoff,
# an `ENDED` from elsewhere — and a delayed `RUNNING` or `CLOSED` written over
# it would be exactly the overwrite the generation exists to refuse. Nothing is
# written then, and the lane is NAMED so a person can read it.
#
# THE MUTEX IS TAKEN WITHOUT DYING FOR IT. `write_event` has already released it
# and its line is already committed: a `die` here would abort a caller whose
# work is on disk, so a mutex nobody could take within 20s costs the snapshot
# and says so, never the event.
#
# AND IT WRITES ONLY FOR A LEGACY LANE, ON EVIDENCE IT WAS HANDED (ruling
# 2026-10-04, design decision 21). Three things must all hold before the
# snapshot moves — `RUNNING` for a `STARTED`/`RESUMED`, `CLOSED` for an
# `ENDED`/`RETIRED`:
#   * the verb is one of those four;
#   * the caller's seam read said 8 — this lane carries no managed-owner
#     marker and no vocabulary of one — because a managed lane's lifecycle is
#     the managed ledger's and an unknown one is nobody's to write;
#   * a pre-image was taken before the line was written and the snapshot still
#     matches it under the mutex.

# CREATES NOTHING and `resume` RESETS NOTHING"*, and never a `git reset`, a
# `git stash`, a `git checkout -f` or a `worktree add --force` to make the next
# run succeed. So this read runs `git status`, `git log @{u}..`, `git rev-parse`
# and `git worktree list --porcelain` and NOTHING ELSE, names the act a person
# takes, and leaves every tree exactly as it found it — a missing tree included,
# whose rebuild is the estate's own `resume <Name>` and is a person's to run.

# ONE PATH, ONE SPELLING — the physical one, or the path itself where it cannot
# be resolved (a path that is gone still has to be comparable).
#
# THE REPORT READS THREE SOURCES AND THEY DO NOT AGREE ABOUT SPELLING. A sidecar
# holds the path the poll was given, `git worktree list --porcelain` answers with
# the PHYSICAL path, and the on-disk sweep walks the recorded `dir`. Every estate
# with a `projects` symlink reaches its checkouts through it — and on macOS
# `$TMPDIR` and `$HOME` are under `/var`, which IS a symlink to `/private/var`,
# which is how four cases of this section went red on that runner alone at
# `612ba5c` (`expected [dirty], got [dirty unmanaged]`): every tree was reported
# TWICE, once as the tree it is and once as a tree nobody manages. `612ba5c`
# resolved the lane's OWN checkout for exactly this reason and left the trees
# under it unresolved. `cd -P` is the portable resolver, for the reason

# it, over the `lane-tree-now` arm below, so the WRITERS section a person reads
# and the sidecar a recovery reads can never be two different readings.

# Every read below used to end in `|| printf 'unknown'`, `|| printf 'none'` or

# unreadable, whose index is locked or whose HEAD is corrupt produced a RECORD
# THAT LOOKED CLEAN AND PUBLISHED, and a later reconciliation comparing against
# it would call a tree holding work `missing` rather than `possible-loss`. A
# read that failed is never an answer (R22, Amendment 7(d)), so it is no longer
# converted into one: the caller is told the observation could not be made.
#
# TWO THINGS ARE ANSWERS AND NOT FAILURES, and they are named rather than
# guessed. A branch with NO COMMIT YET has `unborn` for a head — HEAD is a
# symbolic ref to a branch that does not exist, which is an ordinary state and
# not a broken repository. And a branch with NO UPSTREAM CONFIGURED has `none`,
# which is exactly the distinction the inventory records an upstream for. A
# branch whose upstream IS configured and whose remote-tracking ref is not here
# — the ordinary state of a branch whose remote was deleted after its merge — is
# the third: the configured spelling is recorded, and the count against a ref
# this checkout does not have is `unknown` rather than the `0` that reads as

  # AMENDMENT 8, R-A8-4 — THE UUID APPEND IS CELL-SCOPED.
  #
  # `replace-in-row` refuses unless its anchor occurs exactly once in the WHOLE
  # ROW, and the anchor for a session-cell append is a transcript uuid — which
  # the 6(c) stamp writes into the STATE cell again on every launch (`RESUMED by
  # <uuid> … launching claude --resume <uuid>` — twice more per launched start).
  # Measured against `origin/main` on 2026-09-12, `openRepoProject-1`'s own row
  # carries its current uuid THREE times and its previous one three times, so
  # the single most load-bearing new act in Amendment 8(d) — recording the
  # transcript the harness minted — could not run on the lane the amendment was
  # written for.
  #
  # So the anchor is matched INSIDE THE SESSION CELL and nowhere else, and must
  # occur exactly once THERE. `replace-in-row`'s whole-row rule is unchanged and
  # is still right for what it is for: a state cell says the same thing in two
  # places all the time, and a blind replace there would rewrite the wrong one.
  #
  # AND THE TEXT IS APPENDED AT THE END OF THE CELL, NOT AT THE ANCHOR. This is
  # the second half of the same finding and it is not cosmetic: the cell spells
  # its ids `harness `<uuid>`` — inside backticks — so a replace AT a bare-uuid
  # anchor writes `harness `<uuid> → harness <new>`` and puts the new id inside
  # the old one's code span. The anchor's job is to prove that the cell this
  # checkout holds is the published one the caller read (Amendment 6(b): the
  # cell is a HISTORY, oldest first, and the last id is the lane's current
  # session); the APPEND's job is to add a lineage after all of them. Those are
  # two different positions, and conflating them corrupted the cell.
  #
  # Anything that is not an append — a cell that must really be rewritten — is
  # `replace-in-row`'s business, in front of a person.

  #
  # Ratified 2026-09-14T09:24:35Z, verbatim *"Ratify as drafted (Recommended)"*,
  # on Brett Heap's request of the same day, verbatim *"we need the ability to
  # rename a lane"*. `lane-rename <old> <new>` on PATH is the word a person
  # types; THIS is its write. The two are one act only because the word also
  # renames the tmux window and types `/rename <new>` into the pane — neither of
  # which a register writer may do for a session it is not (Amendment 16(f), and
  # Amendment 12(h)'s M1 for why the typing is the only path a running session's
  # name has).
  #
  # FOUR MOVES, ONE COMMIT (clauses (b)–(e)): the row's key cell, the object
  # log, the handoff, and `lanes/aliases.tsv`. They are one commit because ANY
  # TWO OF THEM APART IS A STATE NO READER CAN READ — a row under `<new>` whose
  # log is still `<old>.md` is a lane whose history `who --lane` cannot find, and
  # an alias without the row it points at is a name that resolves to nothing. So
  # every refusal in clause (a) is made BEFORE THE FIRST BYTE IS WRITTEN, and
  # each one of them says "Nothing was written": this command moves four files
  # and a half-done rename is not something a second run can finish.
  #
  # AND THE `git mv` OF CLAUSES (c) AND (d) IS A PLAIN `mv` PLUS A PATHSPEC.
  # `git mv` is one command and it also STAGES, which is the one thing this file
  # never does: `commit_push` commits from its PATHSPECS precisely so that a
  # peer's uncommitted work in this shared checkout can never be swept into a
  # lane's commit (Amendment 5(d), and the sweep that made `--no-sweep` the
  # default). Both paths go in as pathspecs of the one commit and git records
  # the rename from the content, as it always does. `ensure_log`'s two-step
  # `mv` is not needed either: a case-ONLY rename is refused below, so the two
  # names are two files on every filesystem this ships to.

  # first version of this returned 1 for both and both scripts read 1 as "no
  # holder" / "pre-cutover lane" — a broken helper turned a refusal into a
  # silent pass, which is the one thing a boundary act must never do.

  # The fifth field is Amendment 8 ruling (g)'s: the caller must not have to

  #
  # ALL READ-ONLY; all answer out of `origin/<branch>` as every Amendment 7
  # read does; all honour `LANES_NO_FETCH=1`, because each one sits in front of
  # a launch and a launcher must not sit on the network to open a terminal; and
  # all follow Amendment 7(d)'s fail-closed convention — 0 an answer, 8 NO
  # ANSWER, 64 a usage error of their own, and anything else a failed read that
  # a caller must not read as "nothing to report".
  #
  # WITH ONE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS THE ONE EVERY UN-UPGRADED WORKSTATION IS IN:
  # a `lanes-edit.sh` that has never heard of one of these exits **2** for an
  # unknown subcommand, exactly as a pre-Amendment-8 one did for `swapped`.
  # That is A HELPER PREDATING THE AMENDMENT THAT ADDED THE READ — expected and
  # silent — and a caller falls to its next rung there rather than refusing.
  # The two kinds of 2 are told apart by the helper's own WORDS and not by its
  # status: the `*)` arm below says "unknown subcommand" and no other refusal
  # here does.

  # ADOPTION ACT 0 SHIPS `session-lane`, AND IT IS BELOW RATHER THAN HERE.
  # `opensoft/brett-wip#5` @`3719d97` added it and `openRepoTools#24` — MERGED as
# `d4b5710` on this repository's `main`, which is the sha act 3 is cited by from
# here on rather than a branch name — ported that
  # commit into this copy, so this branch carries NO second implementation of it
  # (A11 Addendum 3, CF-T11: act 0 ships FOUR items, and that is the fourth).
  # `3719d97` IS THE MERGE COMMIT. Act 0 merged 2026-09-13T19:14:37Z, squashed,
  # so the draft head `95e7a4c` this comment used to cite is not an ancestor of
  # `origin/main` at all (F-X18, A11 Addendum 4 ruling 13).
  # `/restart`'s step 2(b) and `lane-start`'s step 3b both call the ported arm.

  # The lane bound to a window OF THE ASKING WORKSTATION. Three callers share
  # this one implementation — the launcher's precedence 3, `/restart`'s step
  # 2(c), and the `/lane-swap` skill's step 1 — and it owns the `<@id>`-versus-
  # ref agreement rule for all three (A11 Addendum 2, `R-A11-8`).
  #
  # The optional workstation comes FIRST, exactly as `swapped [<ws>]` takes it,
  # and is told from the ref by shape: a ref is an `@id` or carries a `:`, and
  # a workstation name is neither.

  # (probed), `workstation` (a container with no export, writing the Rule 10
  # name for its host), `kernel` (the `uname`/`/proc/version` probe) or

  # THE OBSERVATION, FROM THE ONE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT (Copilot round 5 on #97).

  # this arm it made that observation ITSELF — a second implementation with its
  # own error handling, in which a failed upstream lookup became `none` and a
  # failed `log @{u}..` became `0`. One function answers both now: the handoff
  # records what this prints, for its WRITERS section and for the sidecar alike,
  # and `lane-reconcile` recomputes with the same code. It touches no lane, no
  # register and no lock — it reads one path with git.
