# `/restart [<lane>]` — bind this session to its lane

Lane-collision-protocol **Amendment 11 clause (f)**, with **decision 7**'s argument. This is the act for a
session that **started bare or in an unnamed window** — the windows still called `claude`, a `claude` typed
by hand, a session that came up before the launcher carried clause (b). It runs **in** that session.

**What it never does, and why each one was paid for:**

- **It never runs the launcher and never resumes anything itself.** `restart <lane>` is the outside half and
  it `exec`s; a session cannot exec a launcher over itself, so this one binds the window and prints.
- **It never opens a picker and never names a title.** Ratified decision 3: *"never a picker, never a
  menu"*. The one command it may print carries an **exact uuid**, so no picker opens and no title is
  filtered.
- **It asks at most nothing.** A printed listing is not a picker: it asks nothing, returns nothing, and the
  next act is a new command the operator types.

`$L` is the register's reader and writer. Prefer it on `PATH` — `openRepoTools --install` puts it there —
and fall back to the symlink Amendment 5 left:

```sh
L="$(command -v lanes-edit.sh || printf '%s' ~/projects/xFactory/lanes-edit.sh)"
WS="$("$L" workstation 2>/dev/null | cut -f1)"    # decision 8(d): configuration, never `hostname`
```

## 1. The window

```sh
tmux display-message -p '#{session_name}:#{window_index} #{window_id} #{window_name}'
```

**No tmux → REFUSED**, naming the manual act: `lane-start --no-launch --dir <path> <lane>`. This skill binds
a **window**; with no window there is nothing to bind.

## 2. The lane

**With a `<lane>` argument, SKIP THIS STEP ENTIRELY and go to step 3 with that lane** — the operator's word
beats every inference, exactly as `--lane` does at clause (b)'s precedence 1 (decision 7 point 6). Check only
that the register has a row for it (`"$L" register-row <lane>`, exit 0); a lane the register does not carry
is a **REFUSED** naming `lanes`.

With no argument, four rungs, **first answer wins, and every one of them is an exact match**:

```sh
# (a) THE WINDOW'S OWN NAME. `lane-start` is the only thing that ever writes it,
#     so the name is a statement of intent in the way `--lane` is.
lane=""
win_name="$(tmux display-message -p '#{window_name}')"
LANES_NO_FETCH=1 "$L" register-row "$win_name" >/dev/null 2>&1 && lane="$win_name"

# (b) THIS SESSION'S OWN UUID, in the register's session cell (R-A11-7).
#     THE READ THAT ANSWERED ON THIS ESTATE THE MORNING THIS WAS WRITTEN: this
#     lane's session had resumed through a bare `claude --resume`, Amendment
#     8(e)'s SessionStart hook fired and printed the lane, and NO STAMP WAS
#     WRITTEN and the window stayed `claude`, because `lane-start` did not run.
#     (a) answers nothing there; the window read answers nothing on a tmux
#     server that has just been replaced; and the swap record offers the
#     workstation's newest swap, which was a different lane. THE HOOK KNEW,
#     exactly and with no question, through this same read — `lane_of_session`,
#     which clause (h) exposes as a subcommand. One implementation, two callers.
[ -n "$lane" ] || lane="$(LANES_NO_FETCH=1 "$L" session-lane "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null)" || lane=""

# (c) THE WINDOW THE OPERATOR IS STANDING IN, out of the swap records. The
#     `<@id>` first and the `<session>:<index>` second, and either only where
#     that window still exists — `window-lane` owns that fence AND the rule that
#     a record carrying an `<@id>` is matched on its ref only where the window
#     now holding that ref reports that same id. Three callers, one
#     implementation: this skill, the launcher's precedence 3 and `/lane-swap`.
if [ -z "$lane" ]; then
  wid="$(tmux display-message -p '#{window_id}')"
  lane="$(LANES_NO_FETCH=1 "$L" window-lane "$WS" "$wid" 2>/dev/null)" || lane=""
  [ -n "$lane" ] || lane="$(LANES_NO_FETCH=1 "$L" window-lane "$WS" "$(tmux display-message -p '#S:#I')" 2>/dev/null)" || lane=""
fi

# (d) NOTHING MATCHED — PRINT THE PER-REPO LISTING AND STOP (decision 7 point 6).
#     This replaces the first draft's one confirmation on the workstation's
#     newest swap, which on a real estate offered the wrong lane.
if [ -z "$lane" ]; then
  root="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)"
  origin="$(git -C "${root:-.}" remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed -E 's#\.git$##; s#^git@[^:]+:##; s#^ssh://[^/]+/##; s#^https?://[^/]+/##')"
  LANES_NO_FETCH=1 "$L" lanes ${origin:+--repo "$origin"} ${root:+--dir "$root"}
fi
```

**AN EXIT `2` FROM ANY RUNG FALLS TO THE NEXT RUNG, NEVER TO A REFUSAL.** `2` is what a `lanes-edit.sh` that
has never heard of `session-lane`, `window-lane` or `lane-dir` exits for an unknown subcommand, exactly as a
pre-Amendment-8 one did for `swapped` — **a helper predating the amendment that added the read, expected and
silent**, told from a caller's bug by the helper's own words rather than by its status. Until the tooling is
installed everywhere, **2 is the answer every workstation gives**, and a `/restart` that refused there would
refuse everywhere (`R-A11-8`, on RV-T3).

**Outcome where every rung answered 8 or 2: `NO LANE FOR THIS WINDOW` [8]**, with the listing above and
`lane-start --no-launch <repo> <n>` filled in from the window's own name where it parses as `<repo>-<n>`.

## 3. The directory

```sh
dir="$(LANES_NO_FETCH=1 "$L" lane-dir "$lane" 2>/dev/null)" || dir=""
[ -n "$dir" ] || dir="$PROJECTS_ROOT/${lane%-*}"      # 8 → the default; nothing is backfilled
```

**Not a directory → REFUSED**, naming `--dir`. A restart that lands in the right transcript and the wrong
directory loses the repository's `CLAUDE.md` and the lane's memory, silently (Evidence 3).

## 4. The decision — **before** anything is written

```sh
row="$(LANES_NO_FETCH=1 "$L" register-row "$lane")"
cell_last="$(LANES_NO_FETCH=1 "$L" last-session "$lane" 2>/dev/null)" || cell_last=""
```

Compare `$cell_last` with `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`:

- **(a) they MATCH, or the cell names no uuid → step 5.**
- **(b) they DIFFER and a transcript for `$cell_last` is in the lane's directory** →
  **print exactly `claude --resume <uuid>` and STOP.** Nothing appended, no window renamed, no stamp, no
  object line. Outcome `RESUME REQUIRED <lane>` **[0]**.
- **(c) they DIFFER and that uuid has no transcript here → step 5**, and step 5's report says so and names
  Amendment 8(d)'s deferral.

**THE DECISION COMES BEFORE THE BIND, AND THAT IS `R-A11-2`.** Binding first and comparing after makes the
comparison a **tautology**: `lane-start --no-launch` performs step 3b and the `append-session-id` itself, so
the cell's last id after it is by construction this session's, and the `RESUME REQUIRED` outcome could fire
only where that append had been **refused** — the one place printing an old uuid is wrong. Comparing first
also refuses the contamination clause (d) rule 1 names: a session that is not the lane's lineage must not
rename the lane's window or stamp its row on the way to telling the operator where the lane actually is.

## 5. The bind

```sh
lane-start --no-launch --dir "$dir" "$lane"
```

It renames the window, writes the row stamp, Amendment 6(c)'s session-cell append where it can prove the
window is the lane's, the lane's `RESUMED` object line with clause (c)'s `dir`, `profile` and `window`
sub-fields, and the handoff's Rule 3 stamp — and it prints the `claude` command on stdout.
**`/restart` does NOT run that command.**

## 6. The cell — **on 4(c) only**, and only after step 5 exited 0 and renamed the window

```sh
"$L" append-session-id "$lane" "<the uuid step 4 read>" \
  "→ harness <this session's uuid> (transcript uuid; profile ${CLAUDE_PROFILE_NAME:-unknown})"
```

Exit 0 → the cell now names the conversation the operator is in. **Refused → the cell is REPORTED STALE and
the act is printed verbatim; `RESTARTED` is never printed over a cell that stayed stale.**

**It is `/restart`'s act and not `lane-start`'s, and the reason is mechanical.** Under clause (d) rule 1
`lane-start` proves ownership by the window's **name** or by `live-holder` answering `here`; on the 2(c) path
the rename is `lane-start`'s own act a hundred lines **after** step 3b, so it correctly declines. `/restart`
has the proof already: step 2 resolved this window to this lane out of the register, and step 4 read the
anchor out of the published cell. The cell is **appended to**, never replaced — Amendment 6(c)'s own act, so
the old id stays in the row as history.

Where the row records **no** uuid at all there is no anchor to append to: `lane-start` prints its own hint,
`/restart` passes that hint through **verbatim**, prints no `--resume` beside it, and reports the same
outcome.

## 7. The name — the last line, and the one act it ever asks for

Where the harness's record name for **this** session is not `<lane>`, the **last** line printed is:

```text
/rename <lane>
```

**Printed, never run.** There is no API to rename a running session from inside. Evidence 4: this lane's
transcript carries `customTitle: openRepoProject-1`, set once by `/rename`, while every process that resumed
it through a bare `claude --resume <uuid>` carried a **derived** record name — `openrepoproject-b9`, `-1e`,
`-27`, `-45` — and the derived name is what the statusline's `session_name` and `ListAgents` display.
Amendment 8(e)'s `SessionStart` hook prints the same line where the record's name differs from the lane, for
the session that never runs `/restart` at all. It is not a question and not a choice: there is exactly one
lane and exactly one spelling of it.

## The outcomes

A skill has no process exit status, so these are the words `/restart` prints; the helper codes it read are in
brackets, on Amendment 7(d)'s fail-closed convention. **`3` is not among them**, because `lanes-edit.sh`
already uses 3 for an unpushed commit or a rebase conflict and a code that already means something else is a
code a caller cannot act on.

| outcome | when | what is printed |
|---|---|---|
| `RESUME REQUIRED <lane>` **[0]** | 4(b) | exactly one line, `claude --resume <uuid>`, and stop. Nothing is written. |
| `RESTARTED <lane>` **[0]** | 4(a) with step 5 at 0; or 4(c) with step 5 at 0 **and** step 6 extending the cell | the lane, the window, the directory, and the `claude` command step 5 printed and `/restart` did not run. On 4(c), two further lines: that the recorded session has no transcript here, naming Amendment 8(d)'s deferral, and that the cell now names this session |
| `RESTARTED <lane>, CELL STALE` **[8]** | step 5 at 0, but step 6 was refused **or** the row records no uuid to anchor to | everything the `RESTARTED` row prints, plus the exact `append-session-id` act verbatim and which of the two cases it is. **8**, not 0: the bind happened and one fact is still missing |
| `NO LANE FOR THIS WINDOW` **[8]** | **every** rung of step 2 answered **8** or **2** | the per-repo listing, and `lane-start --no-launch <repo> <n>` filled in from the window's own name where it parses |
| `REFUSED: <reason>` **[2]** | no tmux, no directory, a `<lane>` the register does not carry, or step 5 exited 2 | the reason, and the helper's own stderr verbatim |
| `REFUSED: <reason>` **[1]** | any other non-zero from any helper, step 4's read included | which read failed, and its stderr |

**Step 3b's fence is TWO VETOES and no permission, and `/restart` never trips either.** When step 5 runs
`lane-start --no-launch`, that script decides whether to learn the uuid live in this window. Its fence is the
**register veto** — a uuid that belongs to another row is never taken, read through `session-lane` and
fail-closed — and the **window-name veto**: a window named for another lane never lends its session. Neither
the window's name being the lane nor `live-holder` answering `here` is a *condition for taking*, because at
step 3b the window is usually still called `claude` and there is no holder here (`R-A11-12`, which corrects
`R-A11-1` a second time). `/restart` reaches step 5 only after step 2 resolved this window to this lane out
of the register and step 4 compared the ids, so by then neither veto has anything to fire on — which is why
step 6 is `/restart`'s act and not `lane-start`'s.

**A live FORK of this lane's transcript is a defect, and it is named wherever this skill meets one**
(ratified decision 8(e), from Evidence 6). `"$L" forks <lane>` lists them. A fork is never the holder and
must never write the register; retiring one is `kill <pid>`, typed by a person, because ending somebody's
process is not a tool's act (Amendment 8(f)).

**`/restart` binds a window. It does not choose a conversation.** Those are two questions and this skill
answers only the first; the second is Amendment 6(b)'s and stays there.
